<h1>Strawberry Perl and SDL</h1>
<p>OS: MS Windows; Release: 7; Arch: x86_64;</p>
<p>If you want to use perl and SDL on Windows, you'll need to download a version of perl for MS Windows.</p>
<p>(The source code is available, but you'll find it easiest when getting started to work with binaries - which is the normal software distribution mode for Windows.)</p>
<p>Before you start, you'll probably want to download:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.winzip.com/win/en/index.htm">WinZip</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">gedit</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client">FileZilla</a></li>
  <li>You may also prefer using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/">Console</a> instead of Windows cmd</li>
</ol>
<p>The preferred implementation of perl for Windows is Strawberry Perl. You can download that here: (<a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">http://strawberryperl.com/</a>). If you have previously tried to install another perl, uninstall that and reboot before continuing.</p>
<a href="http://strawberryperl.com/"><img src="strawberry_perl_05.png" width="75" border="0"></a>
<p>During the installation accept all the options which are offered by the installation program. Perl will be installed in <b>C:\strawberry</b>. If you accepted and said 'yes' to all options at installation, the <b>perl</b> command will now be in your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">path</a>.
<p>You'll know that you've installed Strawberry correctly by navigating to a folder with a perl program in it; <i>right</i>-click and you should see the default option is 'Execute Perl Program'.</p>
<a href="strawberry_perl_01.png"><img src="strawberry_perl_01.png" width="75" border="0"></a>
<p>(You should use FileZilla to download files from the programming server with which you can test the installation of perl and SDL.)</p>
<p>For purposes of this how-to, you should now start a command prompt session.</p>
<p>For convenience, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MS-DOS_commands">change directory</a> to <b>C:\strawberry</b> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MS-DOS_commands">copy</a> into it the test files you downloaded.</p>
<p>When you run a program at the Windows CLI, either type:
<pre>perl somefile.pl</pre> or <pre>somefile.pl</pre>
- you shouldn't type <b>./</b> before the file name and you <i>won't</i> need to <b>chmod</b> the file before running.</p>
<p>If you've downloaded a test file with a <b>use SDL</b> statement you should get an error if you try to run it, since we don't have SDL installed yet. Test this now. Sample output is here:
<pre>
C:\strawberry\test>perl somefile.pl
Can't locate SDL.pm in @INC (@INC contains: C:/strawberry/perl/site/lib
C:/strawberry/perl/vendor/lib C:/strawberry/perl/lib .) at somefile.pl line 2.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at somefile.pl line 2.
</pre>
<p>Now we can configure cpan.</p>
<p>Type: <pre>cpan Bundle::CPAN</pre> and accept any options offered (just press return). When this is done, type:<pre>exit</pre> to return to the DOS prompt.</p>
<p>Now type: <pre>cpan SDL</pre> and watch your screen. Accept anything offered as an option (just press return). You may see a Windows alert about a program not responding. If the alert appears it should be about <b>mixer_channels</b>. Close the alert and wait for the program to complete.</p>
<a href="strawberry_perl_02.png"><img src="strawberry_perl_02.png" width="75" border="0"></a><a href="strawberry_perl_03.png"><img src="strawberry_perl_03.png" width="75" border="0"></a>
<p>If you saw no errors you'll see a success message at the end of installation and you can proceed with testing your program. You should now have a working perl and SDL on Windows.</p>
<p>If you <i>did</i> see an alert you'll probably see a message like this below at the end of the installation attempt:
<pre>Test Summary Report

</pre>
<a href="strawberry_perl_04.png"><img src="strawberry_perl_04.png" width="75" border="0"></a>
<p>If your error message is like that shown above (with only that 1 error), you can try to <i>force</i> the installation as follows:
<pre>
cpan -f SDL
</pre>
<p>During the <i>force</i>d installation you will still see an alert message; and at the end you'll likely see an error message also. Even so, test your program. The final error message itself is probably an error resulting from the force. You should now have a working perl and SDL.</p>
<p>If you see a different error message to that shown above, read the <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/support.html">Strawberry support/documentation page</a>. After that, considering uninstalling, rebooting, re-installing and then consider forcing again.</p>
<p>If Perl runs but you have problems similar to <a href="http://www.fachtnaroe.com/help/sdl_image_load_error.shtml">here</a>, try using <b>SDL::get_error</b> as described there to get more information on any error.</p>
