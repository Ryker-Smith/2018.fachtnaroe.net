  <p>On Thurs 99 I arrived at work a few minutes early. I can be late on any given day but I try even harder not to be on Thursdays. Thursday is programming day. That's the highlight of the week for me. If that day goes well I get to sit for ages at a time solving puzzles with my students. And anyone who knows me knows I like solving puzzles.</p>
<p>I was also getting in those few minutes early to make sure that Room 15 (The Regional Computer Education Centre) was ok after installation of new equipment the previous evening. I had a small doubt that all might be ok but had been reassured very certainly that it would be.</p>
<p>Instead of evrything hunky-dory working (but no-one around to ask questions of to make sure the work had been done correctly), there was no one around, and the classroom was in a mess. Truthfully, it did cross my mind that the doors had been left open....</p>.

<p>'I cannot teach. I cannot do my core business because of this.' And the bit she wants to complain about on the phone is that once - during about a five minute call - in context, and not towards her but about the situation - I used the word 'fuck'. I did. I said 'this is very fucking annoying'. And it was. And now I've said it again. fuck. Still nobody died from it that time either, did they? Did they fuck as ever. Still those are the joys of dealing with SmashIT. Full of themselves, instead of full of ability.</p>
