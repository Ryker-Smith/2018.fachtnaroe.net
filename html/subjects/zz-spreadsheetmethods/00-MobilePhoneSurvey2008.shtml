<h1>Spreadsheet Methods Project - 2008</h1>

<h2>Outline:</h2>
<h3>You are going to carry out a survey of mobile phone usage patterns. You will gather data on N+1 people and include their responses to a survey questionnaire (DCF) in the spreadsheet. The data will then be used to produce graphs in order that the data may more easily be understood. In this scenario the spreadsheet is playing the role of a Management Information Tool.</h3>
<h3>For the purposes of this assignment it will be assumed that these are the mobile phone companies in Ireland:</h3>
<center>
<table width="25%">
<tr><td><h2>Company</h2></td><td><h2>Prefix</h2></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;3</td><td>&nbsp;(083)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Meteor</td><td>&nbsp;(085)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;O2</td><td>&nbsp;(086)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Vodafone</td><td>&nbsp;(087)</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<h3>For each person you survey you will give then a questionnaire seeking the following data:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Which service provider they are with</li>
<li>Are they prepaid or postpaid customers</li>
<li>How satisfied (0-5) are they with their phone company</li>
<li>Do they have a prefix from another company (ie have they moved in the past)</li>
<li>Would they move in the future</li>
<li>Would they keep their number if moving in the future (assume 'yes' to 5 above)</li>
</ol>

<h3>For each person surveyed obtain the First and Last names on the questionnaire as well as the first line of their address. Each of these three elements will go in a separate field, last name first to allow alphabetical sorting. This data will not be used in the graphing process; however all the data will ultimately be aggregated from each student and this data will be used to prevent duplication of persons surveyed. <b>Under no circumstances is a persons full phone number to be collected or stored.</b></h3>

<h3>The number N represents a number of people. It will be displayed on the website. This number of people +1 more should be surveyed.</h3>

<h3>The object of the +1, or extra person, is to enable you to generate the spreadsheet and graphs with N people, then to delete one of those people and replace them with the +1<sup><small>th</small></sup>  person. This will show that you are able to alter the spreadsheet and that the formulas in your spreadsheet are functional.</h3>
	
<h3>The use of IF statements for 'sanity-checking' the data will satisfy the FETAC requirements for the project.
Ensure you refer to the general guidelines for projects in order to have all three required sections.</h3>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The whole project should be covered by a ‘My Own Work’ form, available on the school Intranet, signed and scanned.</li>
<li>The whole project should be stapled top left, and punched for inclusion in an A4 folder.</li>
<li>Page numbering is preferred – this may need to be overprinted manually.</li>
<li>Each section should be preceded by a simple section page stating 1. Design, 2. Implementation etc.</li>
<li>The project text should be standard formatted as appropriate. Marks may be lost otherwise.</li>
<li>The Design Overview section should not exceed 1 A4 page.</li>
<li>The Design section should include the design of the data Capture Form.</li>
<li>The Design Planning stage is not limited in length and can be as long as required to correctly specify the intention for the project.</li>
<li>Each of the printouts in the Implementation phase should be marked to indicate which is which.</li>
<li>Include a completed scanned Data capture Form in the Implementation section.</li>
<li>Ensure you have some form of IF statement in your project. If you have a LOOKUP formula you won’t be required to use an IF.</li>
<li>Provide at least one printout showing your formulas.</li>
<li>You should check your submission prior to handing them in against the marking scheme which is available on the course website.</li>
<li>No handwriting of any form (except in the scanned pages, and ‘My Own Work’ signature) should be on any page.</li>
<li>Submission is by paper in the submission box in Room 15 or as otherwise specified.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extra:</h2>
<h3>If you have time, include 2 other questions in the questionnaire:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Does the surveyed person use the company website</li>
<li>How satisfied (0-5) are they with the website</li>
<li>Does the person have more than one phone</li>
</ol>
