<h2><a id="2014"></a>Assessment 2013-2014:</h2>
Assessment is by <u>three</u> elements, accounting for 100% of the marks. It is the sole responsibility of the student to ensure all parts of all elements are completed in accordance with instructions given.

    <li>Preparatory Study 01: <a href="00-WorkExperience-PreparatoryStudy1-2013-2014.pdf">Local employers</a>
    <aside>
    This is meant to introduce you to the power of the list. It's amazing how much more you can achieve if you <b>write</b> a list; and yet many would say that the time length of making such a list would preclude it from being a useful use of ones time! Doesn't that just make sense? But, no! The very act of calling in the part of the brain controlling the writing action causes another view of the situation, but using the language sense also allows you to put words on the mental image list in your head. And there's the good bit. Because images and text are stored in different parts of the brain that different view must be moderated by a third to differentiate good bad. Which shortens a list considerably, because text thoughts cost more and so are regulated differently, meaning the list is self-shortening just by starting it. Q.E.D.
    <br>"The list is shortened by starting it." <b>Law of the faROE: 1.0</b>
    </aside>
    </li>
    <li>Preparatory Study 02: <a href="00-WorkExperience-PreparatoryStudy2-2013-2014.pdf">National &amp; international employers</a>
    <aside>
    That said, no point padding the list either. You have to make choices too. In this assignment you'll choose 10 employers, large enough to be called National. That's not a special term. That's just a guideline. A Serving-Suggestion, if you will. Whatever you think of as National probably is. Then categorise them as indigenous or otherwise. Then go back over the list to make sure you meet a final criterion. That's not the end of it either. The next part of the assignment starts by thowing doubt on the first number you had in the last part. Devious that. You see, making decisions is important. It doesn't matter what the decision is about or for. It could just be about whether to inhale now, or just wait a second. Just start and then keep making decisions. That's important. Don't stop. I know that'll be tiring at first, but don't let that make you beat yourself up if you need to take a break. Just get back on when you're ready. Soon it'll be second nature. And by about the time you realise it is, you'll 
probably have your first promotion.

    <li>Preparatory Study 03: <a href="00-WorkExperience-PreparatoryStudy3-2013-2014.pdf">Summary of hobbies and interests</a>
    <aside>
    You'd be surprised how often hobbies and interests are the deciding factor when selecting staff. (The office five-a-aside may need a new sweeper, the tag rugby team needs another female player, the department choir can always use good singers etc.) Not only that, but well-chosen interests can open the door to questions in the interview which will allow you to show your enthusiasm and ability to communicate. Just don't put stuff in you can't talk about, because that will show the exact opposite.

    <li>Preparatory Study 04: <a href="00-WorkExperience-PreparatoryStudy4-2013-2014.pdf">Letter of Application</a> (&amp; CV)
    <aside>
    Having made lists of possible employers it's necessary to get through the door to be seen and heard. A good letter and CV are a must. The CV alone isn't normally sufficient by itself, though a very attractive CV can be a door opener; a cover letter, short and to the point should be sent with the CV to give an introduction or a little extra personal information. The cover letter may be the first time you 'speak' to a future employer, so make sure it's clear and direct with good spelling and grammar. The letter will make the CV more effective.
    </aside>
    </li>
    <li>Preparatory Study 05: (Letter of Application &amp;) <a href="00-WorkExperience-PreparatoryStudy5-2013-2014.pdf">CV</a>
    <aside>
    The Curriculum Vitae - CV - has evolved over the years, from the long letters from which it is descended; it needs to find a middle-ground between everything you ever did and only the bits which are relevant - but leaning strongly towards short and to the point. Yours will not be the only CV to be received by the employer, so don't expect them to know just by seeing your name that you're special. To show that, present the CV attractively in a clean crisp style with a planned layout and easy to find information.
