<p>In essays and assignments you are required to present both facts and opinions. Facts to prove you know them; opinions to show you understand the facts and have given your topic some thought.</p>
<p>Opinions should follow facts, as we are expected to form opinions based on fact. When you assert a fact you have to state clearly <i>why</i> it is a fact. Just saying something is so doesn't actually make it so.</p>

<h2>Division by (or into) Zero</h2>
<p>Don't do it.</p>
<p>You can't anyway.</p>
<p>It is a fundamental of data processing that certain common errors have to be caught to avoid problems. One of these is division by zero. Any circumstance where division occurs has to be checked for the possibility of division by zero.<p>

<h2>Start from where?</h2>
<h2>Thunder and lightning</h2>
<p>During an episode of thunder and lightning a lot of energy is released by a storm in the form of sound (thunder) and light. Sound and light travel at different speeds in air. This is why you typically see lightning before you hear the thunder.<p>
<p>You can use this fact to try to get a sense of whether the storm is approaching or moving away from you.</p>
<p>Because the speed of light is so fast compared to that of sound we can almost ignore the speed of sound (treat it as zero) for this trick.</p>
<p>When you see the lightning flash start counting immediately. When you hear the thunder crash, stop counting.</p>
<p>Each count of three seconds is 1 kilometer.</p>
<p>So if the difference between the flash of the lightning and the thunder roar is 5 seconds, the center of the storm is about 1.6Km away from you. If the difference between the next flash and crash is 7 seconds, the storm is now about 2.2Km away and moving away from you.<p>
