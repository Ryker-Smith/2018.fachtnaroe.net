<h2>Senior College PLC Applications Process</h2>
You should by now have analysed the PLC applications process in The Senior College, Clonmel. During your analysis you should have noticed an absence of streamlining in some parts of the system, duplication of effort in other parts, and any other number of issues that might arise in a system that naturally evolved over time rather than was designed by a Systems Analyst.
As part of the new FETAC framework, and as part of the improved quality control systems, all areas of operation will be affected by planned changes, including the PLC application process.
Your project is to examine the application process as it is now understood to exist, and to suggest how the process could be improved using new or existing IT facilities.
Textually and diagrammatically (using Flow Charts) represent the new process you suggest so that someone new to it can understand how it operates. The first half of this project did the same thing for the existing or old system.
Amongst the issues you will have to address are the fact that the applications which are normally received by one of two secretaries who do not operate in the same building. These secretaries and the course co-ordinators are on different computer networks, but all have Internet access.
There is no budget applicable to this project as what is expected is that you will re-define how existing resources would be used. If you suggest any purchases they are expected to be of nominal value. Provide three quotations, where the lowest price is not the compulsory purchase.
In all cases and for all suggestions you are expected to give reasons for your recommendations.
Pay particular attention to suggesting improved use of existing technologies and finding weaknesses in the manner in which they are currently used. There is a principle that data, once digitised, need not be re-entered; is this currently be held to?
Central storage of data, or at the very least centralised rules for the storage of data is very often a key element of efficiency in data management. Does this currently exist?
Your completed project will have two distinct sections: analysis of the existing arrangements and suggestions for improvement.
