<h1>Install SDL</h1>
<p>To install perl SDL on Linux is a little time consuming, but worth it.</p>
<p>You'll need some sample programs (if you can run them it means perl/SDL is working). You'll have to have superuser access, and a mug of coffee.</p>
<p>Start a console session and try to run one of your sample perl programs. You'll probably get at error message such as:</p>
<pre>
Can't locate SDL.pm in @INC (@INC contains: lots of stuff shown here) at programName.pl line 100 (or some other number)
</pre>
<p>That's the first of a series of errors you'll see, from which you'll learn what needs to be installed. After each command below, you'll have to wait a while as software is downloaded and installed.</p>
<pre>
# first make sure kit is up-to-date
yum upgrade 
# now make sure perl is installed (should be already, right?)
yum install perl
# now add the SDL stuff (copy and paste this)
yum install SDL SDL-devel SDL-* SDL_* perl-Alien-SDL perl-SDL 
</pre>
<p>Are you done installing stuff? Probably not. Try to run your test program again and see does it work.</p>
<p>If you get errors similar to that given at the start of this page, you can try asking Mr Google. But you can also try:</p>
<pre>
# to see what's installed for SDL
yum list installed | grep SDL 
</pre>
<p>If there's something missing, yum it in as well. To see what's available try:</p>
<pre>
# to see what's available that might be missing
yum list available | grep SDL
</pre>
<p>If there are still errors, try:</p>
<pre>
# to see what files are in a package:
repoquery -ql  package_name
# to see what provides a missing file:
yum provides */missing_filename
</pre>
<p>At all times, read the error messages, and think your way through the problem. Copying the error messages to Mr G. helps when you get stuck.</p>
