<h2>Programming Component Continued: Task 001</h2>
To practice your skills with the commands used so far, see can you create a program called <b>square.pl</b> that generates the following output when you run it:
<center><img width="90%"  src="/images/square01-pl.png" /></center>
<br>There is no specification given in this case, just guideline output which you should mimic. Normally a program has a specification with which you must comply.
<h2>Task 002</h2>
This is a sample specification for a programming task. Carry this out and ensure you comply with the task instructions.
<b>Specification:</b>
<ol>
<li>Create a program that displays a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_david">Star of David</a> on screen. The Star of David is the symbol on the Israeli flag and consists of two equilateral triangles intersecting. One is 'right way up', the other is 'upside down'.</li>
<li>The right way up triangle should be composed of <b>+</b> symbols, and the upside down triangle should consist of <b>=</b> symbols. Where (or if) the + and = symbols intersect a <b>#</b> symbol should be used.</li>
<li>The Star can be of any size but should be symmetrical within the limitations of the screen display.</li>
<li>The Star should be preceeded by your name displayed on-screen and two clear blank lines. It should be followed by two clear blank lines before the command prompt re-appears.</li>
<li>The file should be called <b>star.pl</b></li>
</ol>
Below is sample output that corresponds with the specification:
<center><img width="90%"  src="/images/star01-pl.png" /></center>
<br>
The next task will test your use of both input and output......
