<h2>Retrieving and searching your saved data</h2>
<p>In the last two tasks you accepted and saved to disk a list of names, and then recalled and printed the full list. If this list represented a database (which, in a simplistic form, it does) you would be unlikely to want all of the names, just one. We did this previously in the program <font face="Courier">names03.pl</font> where we retrieved a name by its number (or if you prefer, it's position in the list). You're going to attempt this again but using the earlier saved file, "names.txt"</p>
<h2>Task 023</h2>
<p>Copy the file <font face="Courier">names03.pl</font> to <font face="Courier">names03b.pl</font>.</p>
<p>Now modify that file so that using the same file-reading mechanism from task <font face="Courier">names02b.pl</font> you can recall one name from the set of names. Use the retrieval section from <font face="Courier">names03.pl</font> for this.</p>
<p><b>HINT:</b>At its simplest, this task involves putting the head of the file <font face="Courier">names02b.pl</font> onto the body of the file <font face="Courier">names03.pl</font></b></p>
<p><b>When the program is completed print it and show it to Fachtna with screen-captures or print-outs of the data generated by the program output. Make sure your program has suitable header sections.</b></p>
<p>Onwards...</p>
