<h2>Storing Multiple Values - <i>still The Easy Way</i></h2>
<p>The previous program begins to solve the issue of how to handle larger amounts of data easily and efficiently. But a question still remains:</p>
<ol>
<li><strike>What would need to be done to change the number of names from 5 to 3?</strike></li>
<li><strike>What would need to be done to change the number of names from 5 to 10?</strike></li>
<li>Is there anyway of shortening the asking and responding section at the end?</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, now that we've found such an efficient way of handling and storing larger amounts of data, there's obviously going to be a spin-off in terms of data retrieval (Q3) as well.</p>
<p>Copy <font face="Courier">names02.pl</font> to <font face="Courier">names03.pl</font>  and make the alterations shown below:</p>
<center><img width="100%" src="/images/names03-01.png"></center>
<p>In this case we are using the same technique for returning a specific name as we did for accepting them into the array; once we know its number <font face="Courier">$all_the_names[$which_name]</font> we can retrieve just that specific name, rather than having to list all the names we have.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with being able to list all the names, but just as in a phone book there is typically only one number we want out of the thousands, it helps to be able to extract only what we want from a larger list. The array <font face="Courier">[<i>index_variable</i>]</font> mechanism allows this.</p>
<p>Onwards...</p>
