<h1>Perl - Part 7</h1>

<h2>Program Line Types</h2>
All lines in a Perl program are either:
<ol>
<li>Blank lines, for appearance.</li>
<li>Comment lines -  for our benefit - giving an internal explanation of the program functions, Author etc. These lines start with a <b>#</b> and a space.</li>
<li>Program or Directive lines. The most common (or only) directive line is <font face="Courier" >#!/usr/bin/perl</font> at the very start of each file. Normal program lines are written in Perl.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Program lines should be indented, again for appearance. Indent consistently by one or by two spaces.<li>
	<li>This tidy appearance can pay major dividends in a larger program when you're fault finding.</li>
	<li>When you start to add program-flow control instructions you'll indent further again, but by the same number of spaces that you've already chosen.
	</ul>
</ol>
These guidlines about program line types are generally true for all programming languages.
<h2>Task 003</h2>
This task again comes with a specification, as well as sample (but completely unnacceptably unfriendly) output.
<b>Specification:</b>
<ol>
<li>Create a file called <b>multy01.pl</b></li>
<li>This program should first display your name and one clear blank line before commencing proper.</li>
<li>The program should prompt the user to enter 3 numbers</li>
<li>The program should then request and accept each number in turn</li>
<li>Once all three numbers have been accepted the program should calculate the product (multiply!) the three numbers</li>
<li>The product should be displayed with suitable explanatory text</li>
<li>One clear line should be displayed at the program end before the command prompt appears</li>
<li><i>Internally</i> the program should have comment lines to indicate Author, Date, Task &amp; Purpose. These comments should <i>not</i> prevent the line <font face="Courier" >#!/usr/bin/perl</font> from being the very first line in the program as this would most likely cause errors.</li>
</ol>
Sample output <b>without any explanatory text - which you must provide</b> is shown here:
<center><img width="90%"  src="/images/multy01-pl.png" /></center>
Hint: Don't re-invent the wheel!
This is a sample comment section for the head of a program:
<br><font face="Courier"><pre>
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Author:	Fachtna Roe	Date:		20061206
# Title:	multy01.pl	Purpose:	To prompt for and
#						to accept three numbers, then to output
#						the product of the numbers.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
</pre></font>
