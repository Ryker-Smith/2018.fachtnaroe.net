<h2>Task 020</h2>
<p>Copy <font face="Courier">names04.pl</font> to <font face="Courier">names05.pl</font> and make the alterations necessary to enable your program to generate output similar to that shown below. The program should now accept and store telephone numbers as well as names. When a record is later specified, <i>it will be specified by name, not number</i>. Then both the name and number are to be returned.</p>
<p>Error checking is in place for record retrieval. Note that the entries are case sensitive, and that you are not required to generate a mechanism to counteract this.</p>
<br>
<center><img width="90%"  src="/images/names05.png" /></center>
<p>In this case we are again using the same program as we did before with a some added/modified code. A program snippet of what can be used is shown before.</p>
<center><img width="100%"  src="/images/names05-01.png" /></center>
<p>When finished you should be able to answer questions on the logic of the program, such as how it flows and what the semaphores are used for.</p>
<p><b>Ensure you print this program once it's complete and show it to Fachtna for assessment.</b></p>
<p>Onwards...</p>
