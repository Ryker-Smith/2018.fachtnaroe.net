</font><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Morpoy Meats Ltd is a small specialty food company based in Dungarvan. They employ several part-time workers each week in the production of their goods. The number of staff working each week varies. These staff are paid in cash.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because individual cash pay packets have to be assembled, it is important that when the wages clerk goes to the bank to withdraw the wages that the correct number of notes and coins to assemble each individual pay packet is withdrawn.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is done by calculating the minimum number of notes and coins required for each person, and then totaling up the number of notes and coins required for all the employees. Because this task is tedious, but easily automated, you have been asked to write a computer program to achieve this.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your program will be run once a week. It will ask how many employees are to be allowed for on this particular week. For that number of employees it will then repeatedly ask the wage of each employee, up to the number of employees for that week.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For each employee the program will then calculate how many 50 notes are required, how many 20 notes, how many 10 notes, how many 5 notes; it will then calculate how many 2, 1, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c, 2c, 1c coins are required. You many assume that no notes above 50 will be used.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A running total of the number of each size of note and coin will be kept. At the end of the program run these running totals will be displayed as the final output of the program.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because there are two wages clerks employed by the company, and one is French, it is advisable to have an option to run the program either in English or in French. This may become an honours option for bonus marks.</p>
