<h1>C Programming Assignment #2 (2001/2)</h1>
<h2>Brief</h2>
<h3>Your target is to create a number sorting program. It will accept a set of numbers which it will then sort into descending order. There will also be names entered which are associated with those numbers. After all the numbers and names are entered the data will then be sorted. After being sorted the numbers will be displayed, with the correct corresponding name displayed opposite each number.</h3>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>Sorting is a fundamental task which is done to better organize data. If you look around you on a day-by-day basis you will see many items which are sorted. The telephone directory, class lists, car registration numbers, buildings on a street.</h3>
<h3>There are several ways of sorting data, the simplest being that used for car registration. With cars the number allocated to each car is just one higher than that of the last previous registration. A listing of car registration numbers would therefore automatically be sorted, by virtue of all new data being added at the end of the list. This method is known as a form of insertion sort, where data is sorted by virtue of being placed in a list in the right position from the start. Many insertion sort applications insert data somewhere into the middle of an already sorted list, maintaining the order of that list.</h3>
<h3>However, not all systems are suitable for that type of sorting. Where a mass of data accumulates without any opportunity for sorting, or at such a rate that the data cannot be sorted as it is added to the list some other method must be used. In this circumstance what may happen is that the data will be entered unsorted into a list as one step of the process and then sorted as a separate step.</h3>
<h3>Whichever mechanism is used (sort while entering or enter and then sort) the output of the process should still be a sorted list. As sorting is such a fundamentally important task, both mechanisms have been the subject on considerable research. Much of the research is geared towards faster (more efficient) sorting, since large volumes of data may take a long time to sort, even with computers. Inefficient sorting mechanisms are inefficient whether they are executed on fast computers or on slow computers.

<h2>Specific</h2>
<h3>One simple and long established sorting mechanism is the bubble sort mechanism. With this method an unsorted list is traversed several times until it is sorted. Each time the list is traversed, the next smallest number is found and placed into the correct sorted position in the list. The list gradually becomes sorted, one number at a time.</h3>
<h3>The mechanism is called bubble sorting because each traversal finds the lightest number which then rises to the top of the list, like bubbles rising to the top of a pool of water, lightest first.</h3>
<h3>A loop is used to progress through the list comparing successive adjacent pairs of numbers. For each pair of numbers if the earlier element is smaller than the later element, the elements are swapped; the next pair of numbers are then compared. As the loop progresses through the list, the next smallest number will constantly be rising to the top of the list, while larger numbers are simultaneously being swapped down through the list.</h3>
<p>What would happen for an initially unsorted list of 500 numbers is this:
<h3>
<table ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=75% BORDER=1 STYLE=text-align:center;>
<tr>
<td>Traversal
<td>Number Of positions Tested
<td>Testing Starts At position
<td>Testing Ends At position
<td>Smallest Number Found At Position
<td>When Found Smallest Number Swapped To Position
<tr>
<td>1
<td>500
<td>1
<td>500
<td>X
<td>500
<tr>
<td>2
<td>499
<td>1
<td>499
<td>X
<td>499
<tr>
<td>...

<td>1
<td>...
<td>X

<tr>
<td>499
<td>2
<td>1
<td>2
<td>X
<td>2
</table>
</h3>>
<h3>The efficiency of the bubble sort algorithm is that it is written in such a way as to ensure that numbers that are already sorted are not traversed again; it also constantly moves the numbers in the direction of their final resting place, thus reducing the number of swap operations that need to be occurred on any later traversal.</h3>
<h2>Informative</h2>
<h3>The application that you will be emulating will be an election votes sorting program. A sample run of a sample program would look like this:
<p>
<table WIDTH=75% ALIGN=CENTER>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>&lt;==Start of sample data==&gt;
Program to accept and sort votes cast in an election. (This
sample operates for 5 candidates). Please follow the instructions below:

Please enter the name of candidate 1: Allen
Please enter the votes cast for candidate Allen: 7902

Please enter the name of candidate 2: Byrne
Please enter the votes cast for candidate Byrne: 10198

Please enter the name of candidate 3:  Dawson
Please enter the votes cast for candidate Dawson: 2015

Please enter the name of candidate 4: Ryan
Please enter the votes cast for candidate Ryan: 4907

Please enter the name of candidate 5: Williams
Please enter the votes cast for candidate Williams: 15231

The order of the candidates is as follows:
Candidate		Name		Votes
    5		Williams		15231
    2		Byrne		10198
    1		Allen		7902
    4		Ryan		4907
    3		Dawson		2015
&lt;==End of sample data==&gt;
</pre>
</table>
</h3>
<h2>Your Task</h2>
<h3>Write a computer program that will carry out the above task. It will use two arrays to store the data which is entered, one for the names, one for the votes. It will use the bubble sort algorithm to sort the votes entered, and based upon that sorting to simultaneously swap about the names of the candidates to make sure the names corresponding with the votes remain correctly matched.</h3>
<h2>Useful</h2>
<h3>Find an example of the bubble sort on the net! Its a well established algorithm though variations may exist. Find the absolute simplest one possible as a starting point.</h3>
<h3>Pay no attention to the names and handling them initially. The issue of names can be dealt with after the sorting of the numbers has been successfully coped with.</h3>
<h3>Make sure you are in attendance in class as a stepwise procedure for handling the assignment will be developed.</h3>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h3>Provide evidence of your planning process, the commented source code and sample data used. You should also include a hand-drawn as well as a SmartDraw formatted flow-chart. Any other appropriate documentation may be included if you wish. The submission should be preceeded with a signed copy of the my own work form.<h3>
