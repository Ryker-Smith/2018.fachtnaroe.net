<p><b><u>Lotto Numbers Program</u></b>
<br>Write a program that generates sets of 6 lotto numbers and displays
them on-screen.
<p><b><u>Overview of Program Flow</u></b>
<br>When the program is run the user should be asked how much money they
wish to spend on the Lotto. The user will type the amount of money (in
pounds) and the program should generate the appropriate number of sets
of 6 numbers (6 numbers for 75p).
<p>When the program has displayed the sets of numbers on the screen the
user should then be asked if they wish to generate more sets of numbers.
If the user declines then the program finishes. (This test may alternatively
be carried out prior to generating any numbers).
<p><b><u>Restrictions</u></b>
<br>1. Negative monetary values are not accepted and must be handled in
some way.
<br>2. A minimum of two plays must be enforced. (A minimum play is &pound;1.50.)
<br>3. Additional plays are &pound;0.75 each.
<br>4. Numbers generated must be in the range of 1-42.
<p><b><u>Assumptions</u></b>
<br>1. No allowance for duplicate numbers need be made.

<p>NCVA Computer Programming, Level 2, Module C20013
<p>================ASSIGNMENT #2=================
<p>Write a program which generates sets of 6 random Lotto numbers (Range
1-42) and prints them onto the screen for the user.
<p>When the program is run the user should be asked how much money they
wish to spend on the Lotto. The user will type the amount of money (in
pounds) and the program should generate the appropriate number of sets
of 6 numbers (6 numbers for 50p).
<p>When the program has displayed the sets of numbers on the screen the
user should then be asked if they wish to generate more sets of numbers.
If the user declines then the program finishes.
<table>

<td>The program will include:</td>

<td>3 WHILE loops</td>

<td>The RANDOM function</td>

<p><b>NOTE: </b>You do not need to worry about duplicate random numbers
being selected.
<p><b>NOTE: </b>The completed PASCAL assignment will be required for submission,
not the executable program.
<p><b>NOTE: </b>You are advised to make good use of the help facilities
of <b>Turbo Pascal</b>.
<p>Send any questions to <a href="mailto:fachtna@cti-clonmel.ie">fachtna</a>
