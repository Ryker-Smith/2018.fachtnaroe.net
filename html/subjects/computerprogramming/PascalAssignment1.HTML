<br><b>Computer Programming (C20013)</b><br><b>Assignment 1</b><br><b>October 1999</b><hr WIDTH="100%"><p><b>Currency Converter Program</b><p>Write a program to convert Euro values to Punt values &amp; vice-versa.<p><b>Restrictions</b><p>1. Negative values are not accepted and must cause the program to halt.<br>2. The amount to be converted must be accepted before either sourceor destination currencies are accepted.<br>3. Final answer should be displayed correct to two decimal places.<p><b>Assumptions</b><p>1. The Euro to Punt conversion factor is 0.787564<br>2. The letters e/E and p/P can be used to represent Euros andPunts, respectively.<p><b>Test Data</b><table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="50%" ><tr><td><b>Input Data&nbsp;</b></td><td><b>Expected Result</b></td></tr><tr><td>-17&nbsp;</td><td>Program should halt</td></tr><tr><td>25 E P</td><td>19.69P</td></tr><tr><td>25 P E</td><td>31.74E</td></tr><tr><td>0&nbsp; P E</td><td>0.00E</td></tr><tr><td>

Yourprogram must determine IF the shape could possibly be a square.<p>If the shape could be a square then your program will WRITE this facton screen. If the shape could not possibly be a square then your programwill WRITE this fact on screen.<p>IF any of the numbers entered are negative then the program should WRITEthat invalid data has been entered and stop immediately without performingany other tests on the data.<p>You must use the PASCAL programming language to complete the assignment.<p>===============================================<p>NOTE: The marking scheme is to be found at \\pretoria\NCVA 1997<p>15 marks are for documenting the program by putting comments in {} whichexplain what certain portions of the code do. 15 marks go for good screenpresentation. In other words, the programs looks good when it runs. 10marks go for the use of indentation - indent 2 spaces under a BEGIN, forexample. 10 marks go for creating a program that will compile. 30 marksgo for a program that does what it's meant to do. 20 marks go for the useand documentation of use of test data. In other words, choose sets of valuesthat should cause different results when the program is executed and demonstratethat the program acts correctly each time.<p>NOTE: The PASCAL tutorial is to be found at<p>http://pretoria.cti-clonmel.ie/<p>NOTE: This assignment counts for the full NCVA module. There will bethree more like it.<p>NOTE: A completion date will be set shortly. Start now to avoid panic/pressure.<p>NOTE: This module is a ***must*** for anyone thinking of studying computersfurther.<p>HINT: Think about the manner in which you would carry out the task *without*a computer. Write down those steps. Double check that the steps you'vewritten down are correct and make sense. If not, make any improvementsnecessary. Then program the computer to carry out the steps in the orderin which you wrote them down. If you include the set of steps in the programdocumentation then you will probably receive extra marks.<p>NOTE: The PASCAL program is what must be submitted, not the compiledexecutable.
