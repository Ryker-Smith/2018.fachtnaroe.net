<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Where
Did The Internet Come From?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The internet was first
thought of in the year 1962. Paul Baran of the RAND corporation(a
government agency) was <SPAN LANG="en-US">commissioned</SPAN> by the
government agency to try find a way that they could maintain control
of their missiles and weaponry after a nuclear attack. <SPAN LANG="en-US">Baran's</SPAN>
finished  document contained several suggestions on how to do this.
His final idea was a packet switched network. A packet switched
network is defined as: <I>&quot;Packet switching is the breaking down
of data into datagrams or packets that are labeled to indicate the
origin and the destination of the information and the forwarding of
these packets from one computer to another computer until the
information arrives at its final destination computer. This was
crucial to the realization of a computer network. If packets are lost
at any given point, the message can be resent by the originator.&quot;
</I>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">6
years later in 1968, the idea was <SPAN LANG="en-GB">realised</SPAN>
when ARPA awarded the ARPANET contract to BBN. </SPAN>BBN had
selected a Honeywell minicomputer as the base on which they would
build the switch. Four nodes were linked from which the switch would
run. The  four nods would be located at University of Califor nia(Los
Angeles), SRI in Stanford, University of <SPAN LANG="en-US">California</SPAN>(Santa
Barbara) and University of Utah. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1972, a huge step was
taken in making the internet what it is today. Ray Tomlinson created
the first e-mail program. The Advanced Research Projects Agency
(ARPA) was renamed The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (or
DARPA). ARPANET was currently using the Network Control Protocol or
NCP to transfer data. This allowed communications between hosts
running on the same network.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1973, Development
began on the protocol later to be called TCP/IP, it was developed by
a group headed by Vinton Cerf from Stanford and Bob Kahn from DARPA.
This new protocol was to allow  computer networks to interconnect and
communicate with each other.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Development began on the
protocol later to be called TCP/IP, it was developed by a group
headed by Vinton Cerf from Stanford and Bob Kahn from DARPA. This new
protocol was to allow diverse computer networks to interconnect and

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1976 the ethrenet was
developed. One year later the UUCP (Unix-to-Unix CoPy) developed at
AT&amp;T Bell Labs and was later used in conjunction with UNIX.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1983, the IAB(Internet
Activities Board) was created. On January 1<SUP>st</SUP> of that
year, every computer network connected to ARPANET had to TCP/IP. It
became the core internet protocol.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Continuous</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">developments</SPAN>  occurred until 1992 when the
greatest advancement happened. This was the world wide web(www.),
which was released by CERN. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">InterNIC created by NSF
to provide specific Internet services: directory and database
services (by AT&amp;T), registration services (by Network Solutions
Inc.), and information services (by General Atomics/CERFnet).Marc
Andreessen and NCSA and the University of Illinois develops a
graphical user interface to the WWW, called &quot;Mosaic for X&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">By 1994, many new
networks had been added to the NSF backbone. Hundred's of thousand's
of new users were added to the INTERNET by this time.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On 30<SUP>th</SUP> May
1995, the National Science Foundation announced that it would no
longer be allowable to have dire t access to the NSF backbone. NSF
contracted with 4 companies to be providers of the <SPAN LANG="en-US">backbone.
These</SPAN> companies would then sell connections to groups,
organisations, and companies. $50 annual fee is imposed on domains,
excluding .edu and .gov domains which are still funded by the
National Science Foundation.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">However, this leads on to
other questions. One of which is who owns the internet. The answer is
not owned by anyone in particular. More of a concept than an actual
tangible entity, the Internet relies on a physical infrastructure
that connects one network to other networks. There are many
organisations, corporations, governments, schools, private citizens
and service providers that all own pieces of the infrastructure, but
there is no one body that owns it all. However. Some organisations
control the running and smooth operation of the internet. This
includes assigning IP addresses and domain names. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Also, due to its openness
 it would seem to be an easy to breakdown. Although it is not
possible to break every internet connection in the world, it is
possible to break certain computers connections to the internet and
computer networks. A virus is one way by which you can stop a
computer functioning.
