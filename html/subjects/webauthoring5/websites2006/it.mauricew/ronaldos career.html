On his day of signing for Real Madrid
<br><br>
Ronaldo's footballing abilities were first recognised when he was 14. 
<br>
He was recommended to the Brazil youth team by World Cup winner Jairzinho, who also arranged for his own former club,
<br>
Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, to sign the boy when he was old enough for a professional contract.In 1993, at the age of 16,
<br>
Ronaldo already had scored 59 goals in 57 matches for Brazil's under-17 squad. By 1994 he had joined the national senior 
<br>
squad, although he did not actually play in the 1994 World Cup in the United States. During World Cup '94, he was given the name 
<br>
"Ronaldinho", to distinguish him from Ronald� in the squad.

<font color="green">
<br>
Ronaldo's European career began when he joined PSV Eindhoven for the 1994-1995 season. He became the Dutch top scorer and attracted 
<br>
the attention of Spain's FC Barcelona. He played for Barca in the 1996-1997 season, scoring 34 goals in 37 appearances, then 
<br>
transferred to Inter Milan the following year.
<P>
Voted the FIFA World Player of the Year in 1996 and 1997, he had a comparatively disappointing performance during the 1998 World Cup, 
<br>
scoring only four goals. Brazil lost the final to the hosts France after he suffered a mysterious fit the night before [1]. Some <br>questioned the decision to play Ronaldo in the final because of the possible physiological aftereffects of the fit [2]. This was the 
<br>
start of a career nightmare for the striker lasting nearly four years.
<P>
A year later, he severely injured his right knee and was out of the game for several months. During his first comeback in 2000, 
<br>
he managed to play only seven minutes during a league game against Lazio before injuring his knee for a second time.
<br>
After two operations and twenty months of rehabilitation, Ronaldo managed a comeback during the 2002 World Cup. Later in 2002 he 
<br>
was awarded the title of World Player of the Year for the third time, and transferred from Inter Milan to Real Madrid for 27,000,000, 
<br>
after frequent disputes with Inter Milan coach Hector Cuper. His transfer to Madrid was the subject of a media frenzy not just laced 
<br>
with the usual hype because of his reputation, but more so because he was now the third successive 'Galactico' (or superstar) signed 
<br>
in as many years by the Spanish Giants as part of their famously hubristic policy of signing the world's biggest superstar football 
<br>
players in order to maintain their levels of success whilst broadening their reaches of fame.
<P>
Ronaldo was such a well known signing that sales of his shirt on the day of his signing alone broke all records the world over. Proof 
<br>
of his fame came with the fact that even though Ronaldo was sidelined through injury until October 2002, fans continued to chant his 
<br>
name in the stands. When Ronaldo finally made his debut and scored the second of his brace from Steve McManaman's pass, it was clear 
<br>
for all to see that the goalscoring Ronaldo of old had returned to club football at last. That same reception was observed on the 
<br>
night of the final game of the season against Athletic Bilbao, where Ronaldo scored yet again to seal his first season with 
<br>
22 league goals (not including the goals in the UEFA Champions League that included a hat-trick in the away at Manchester United), 
<br>
and most importantly, the coveted La Liga Championship title for 2003, where Ronaldo had previously failed to win whilst at FC Barcelona. 
<br>
In the most recent clash between the bitter rivals, (Real & Barcelona), Ronaldo rushed back from an injury for the sake of this match, which, 
<br>
quite surprisingly, ended in a humiliating defeat for Real. In contrast, Ronaldo's compatriot, Ronaldinho, contributed two goals against Real 
<br>
and subsequently was named as the European Footballer of 2005.
<P>
On June 2, 2004, Ronaldo scored an unusual hat-trick for Brazil against arch-rivals Argentina in a CONMEBOL qualifier for the 2006 World Cup. 
<br>
He scored all of Brazil's 3 goals from the penalty spot.
<P>
In April 1999, Ronaldo married Milene Domingues. The marriage lasted four years and ended in divorce. The couple had a son, Ronald (born 2000).
<br>
In 2005 he got engaged and married Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniella Cicarelli, who became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage, their
<br> 
relationship lasted only 3 months. She is most notable for marrying football player Ronaldo in a ceremony held at the Chantilly chateau. The couple's 
<br>
breakup 84 days after their wedding was featured on the cover of many tabloids and magazines. He is currently dating model, Raica Oliveira.
