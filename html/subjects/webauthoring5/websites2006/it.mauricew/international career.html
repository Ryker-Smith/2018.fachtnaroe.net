  Ronaldo made his international debut for Brazil in 1994 against Argentina.   <br>  He went on to be the top scorer during the 2002 World Cup, winning the Golden
  <br>  Boot after bagging eight goals, two of those in the final against Germany,   <br>  and equaling Pelé's Brazilian record of 12 World Cup goals, after the four he   <br>  scored in the 1998 tournament. As of October 2005, he has scored 57 goals in   <br>  90 games.
