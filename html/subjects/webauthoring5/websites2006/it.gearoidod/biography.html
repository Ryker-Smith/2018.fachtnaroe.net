Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on 24 May 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota) is an American singer-songwriter, musician and poet whose enduring contributions to American song are comparable, in fame and influence, to those of Stephen Foster, Irving Berlin, Woody Guthrie, and Hank Williams.

Much of Dylan's best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest. Many involved in the anti-war and civil rights movements found an anthem in his song "Blowin' In The Wind". Millions of young people embraced "The Times They Are A-Changin'" as the rallying cry of the decade.

Dylan expanded the vocabulary of popular music by incorporating politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences into his lyrics. In doing so he created a style which combines an often absurdist lyrical stream of consciousness with social and political imperatives, defying pop music convention and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has nonetheless shown devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock 'n' roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.

Dylan performs with the guitar, piano and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured almost constantly since the late 1980s. Although his contributions as performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.
