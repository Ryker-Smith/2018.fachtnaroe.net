<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Where
did the Internet come from?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Internet has revolutionised how many people communicate. It allows
people to send messages and files to each other, world wide, in a
matter of seconds. It is the fastest and one of the most commonly
used communication tools in the world. It also covers the widest area
and does so inexpensively.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
Internet </FONT></FONT>started in the late 1960s as project of the
U.S. Department of Defense: the military needed a communications
network that would function even if the parts of the network were
broken. They also needed a network that could work between machines
of different types.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In October 1969 two
computers &ldquo;talked&rdquo; for the first time across a telephone
line. This network was known as ARPAnet. As time went on ARPAnet grew
and incorporated many more systems. As the network quickly expanded
academics and researchers in other fields began to use it as well.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Internet Protocol (IP)
was developed in order to get different computers to communicate
through a network. Internet Protocol is a set of laws which any
computers belonging to a network must follow.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The first email programme
was developed in  1972 by Ray Tomlinson of BBN. The Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA) was renamed the Defense Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) in this year as well.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1n 1973 development of
the  protocol TCP/IP began. It was developed by a group headed by
Vinton Cerf (Stanford) and Bob Kahn (DARPA).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Dr. R M <SPAN LANG="it-IT">Metcalfe</SPAN>
 developed a system which allowed coaxial cable to move data
extremely fast in 1976. This system was called Ethernet. In this year
the packet satellite project (SATNET) went into practical use. The
Department of Defense began to <SPAN LANG="en-US">experiment</SPAN>
with th TCP/IP protocol and decided to require it for use on ARPANET.
A year later UUCP developed at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. This was later
used in conjunction with UNIX.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1979 the decentralized
news group network (USENET) was developed by Steve Bellovin, Tom
Truscott and Jim Ellis. The Creation of BITNET, by IBM, &quot;Because
its Time Network&quot;, introduced the &quot;store and forward&quot;
network. It was used for email and listservs.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">2 years later  the
National Science Foundation created backbone called CSNET for
institutions without access to ARPANET. Vinton Cerf proposed a link
between APRANET and CSNET.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On January 1<SUP>st </SUP>of
1983 every computer connected to ARPANET had to use TCP/IP. This
became the standard protocol and completely replaced NCP. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The University of
Wisconsin also created the DNS (Domain Name System) in this year as
well.This allowed packets to be directed to a domain name, which
would be translated by the server database into the corresponding IP
number.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1984 the ARPANET was
divided into two networks: MILNET and ARPANET. MILNET was made to
support the military's needs while ARPANET supported the research
component. The Department of Defense continued to support both
networks.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Also in this year and
upgrade to  CSNET was contracted by MCI. New circuits would be T1
lines, i.5 Mbps which is twenty five times than the old 56 Kbps
lines. IBM would provide advanced routers and Merit would manage the
network</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1990 Merit, IBM and
MCI formed a not for profit corporation called ANS, Advanced Network
&amp; Services, which was to conduct research into high speed
networking. It soon came up with the concept of the T3, a 45 Mbps
line. NSF quickly adopted the new network and by the end of 1991 all
of its sites were connected by this new backbone.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">CSNET was discounted in
1991 after having fulfilled its important role in the provision of
academic network servicing. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Also this year the NSF
established a new network, named NREN, the National Research and
Education Network. The purpose of this network is to conduct high
speed networking research. It was not to be used as a commercial
network, nor was it to be used tosend a lot of the data that the
Internet now transfers.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1992 the Internet
Society was chartered, the World Wide Web was released by CERN and
the NSFNET backbone was upgraded to T3 (<BR><BR>
