<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times">In
the 1957 the USSR launches Sputnik, the first <SPAN LANG="en-US">artificial</SPAN>
earth satellite. After this the United states formed the Advanced
Research Projects Agency known as (ARPA). In 1962 Paul Baran of the
RAND Corporation (a government agency) was asked by the us air force
to study  on how you could maintain its command and control over its
missiles  and bombers, after nuclear attacks this was so the military
could control and know when there country was under attack so they
could plan a counter attack. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT SIZE=3>The
physical  network was constructed in 1969, there were four
minicomputers they where based in, University of California at Los
Angeles, SRI (in Stanford), University of California at Santa
Barbara, and the University of Utah. The network was wired together
by 50 Kbps circuits. In the seventies the (ARPA) was renamed to the
(DARPA) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The first email
program was also created in the seventies it was created by Ray
Tomlinson of th BBN. It was set up by a team headed by Vint Cerf and
Bob Kahn From DARPA, this was a new protocol to allow diverse
computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other it
was the first use of the name of the internet and that was 1974 there
was only 23+ host at this time. Dr. Robert M. Metcalfe develops
Ethernet, which allowed cable to move data extremely fast. Then there
was a project  that was called SATNET which basically was a satilite
network, this network linked the U.S.A and Europe, they used INTELSAT
which were satilites that were owned by a series of different
countries which <SPAN LANG="en-US">meant</SPAN> that it was no longer
exclusively the United States government. By the end of the seventies
there were 111+ host using computers. From the eighties on the
internet was getting bigger. There was a board set up in 1983 called
(IAB) Internet Activities Board. In 1984 the ARPANET was divided into
two networks: MILNET and ARPANET <SPAN LANG="en-US">basically</SPAN> 
this <SPAN LANG="en-US">meant</SPAN> that MILNET was for military and
the other was to support the advanced research component, there was
also other new network that would upgrade to CSNET which 1.5 Mbps
which would make the speed of  the lines twenty times faster than the
old 56Kbps. The new network would be called NSFNET (National Science
Foundation Network) this network wouldn't be finished till 1988 by
this time there were 56.000 host using the internet, the old line
would still named CSNET. By the early 90s there were more and more
people using the internet in 1992 there over 1,136,000 using it, and
by the end of 1995 there were 6,642,000 so from when it started it
developed a bit slow at first but now in 2005 there are millions and
millions of people using the internet it is used every day by
<SPAN LANG="en-US">professionals and by you and me weather it is for
personal or business its is one of the </SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US">easiest
ways to communicate.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times">Nobody
owns the internet well actually everybody owns a piece of the
internet. The internet back bone is owned by the National Science
Foundation, it is currently run under contract by Merit, a joint
venture between IBM and MCI. There registration services</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Times">are provided by AT&amp;T under contract with the
NSF. The least lines that hook the networks together are owned by the
regional Bell operating companies and the long distance carriers such
as MCI, AT&amp;T, Sprint and WilTEL. So the there is not one owner of
the internet we all own it.</FONT></P>

world wide web came from this man pictured above Tim Berners-Lee who
invented the world wide web in 1989, the first system was in 1990, he
was working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research).
He went on to invent  the world wide web-related things such as the
HTML and HTTP these are used to transmit web pages between web
servers and web browsers so this is how he invented the world wide
web. He also wrote the first web client (browser-editor). Tim work in
a computer company before going to CERN, he worked in Image Computers
Systems, Ferndown, Dorset, England and he was a principal engineer
with Plessey Telecommunications, in Poole, England. He is a graduate
of Oxford University, he holds 3Com Founders chair at the laboratory
for computers science and he directs the World Wide Web Consortium
its an open forum of companies and organizations with a goal to lead
the web to its full potential. </FONT></FONT>

be someone out there that can, if you can break the internet I am
sure it can be fixed, when I searched this on the net I got loads of
different site's that were giving tips on how to break the internet,
if these work I don't know I have never tried so I don't know if I
can break the internet maybe I will try to soon.</FONT></FONT>
