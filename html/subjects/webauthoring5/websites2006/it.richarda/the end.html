<div align=justify>The events leading up to September 7, 1996, the tragic day Tupac was shot are as controversial as the shooting itself.  It was said that
there were some problems between Deathrow’s lawyer and Suge’s right hand man, David Kenner and Tupac.  On August 26th, 12
days before Tupac was shot, he was on the set all day and at the studio all night.  On the 27th, he sent Yaasmyn Fula, who managed 
his business affairs, to the studio to get tapes of what he was done.  Deathrow would not allow her access to the tapes as David Kenner, 
Deathrow’s lawyer and Suge’s right hand man, denied her the tapes.  It’s rumored that Tupac had Yaasmyn write Deathrow a letter 
saying that Tupac had finished his last album and would be leaving Deathrow.  Tupac later went back to LA, and although he wanted to go to 
Atlanta to visit relatives, Suge convinced Tupac to go to the Tyson/Seldon fight in Las Vegas as he had promised.</div>

<div align =justify>The Tyson vs. Seldon boxing match was held Saturday, September 7, 1996.  Tupac and Suge sat up front and 
Tupac cheered Tyson on as he had done so many times before.  The fight lasted only 109 seconds. 
While walking through the lobby of the MGM grand after the fight the entourage noticed Orlando Anderson.  In a prior 
incident in a Lakewood Mall, Orlando Anderson stole Travon Lane’s Death Row medallion that happened to 
be a personal give from Suge Knight. Tupac stepped up to Orlando and said "You from the south?"  Tupac then 
punched him in the face knocking him on the ground, after which Suge and the Deathrow entourage proceeded to beat him.  Rumors 
surrounding the shooting have Orlando’s Anderson with Jerry Bonds driving the white Cadillac while Dwayne Keith Davis (Keefee D)
was the shooter.  An article in Details magazine stated that Orlando and his brother wanted to start a studio, but didn’t have the 
resources.  Allegedly after the shooting they came into some money, and the possibility of a pay off for some role in the shooting is 
possible.  Anderson, an alleged crip who claims he’s not affiliated, also denied the shooting and stated he was a possible scapegoat.  
He was shot 2 years later in an incident outside a car wash.</div>
<p>
There were some strange occurrences in Las Vegas according to the book written by Tupac’s bodyguard Frank Alexander. The first, was that permits were not sent ahead of time so they were not allowed to carry guns. The second was that he ended up without his phone, and the third coincidence would come after the fight. After the beating of Orlando Anderson the entourage returned to where they were staying at the Luxor Hotel, a block south of the Las Vegas strip. Tupac changed from tan silk shirt and jeans to a basketball top and sweat pants and wore his Euphanasia Medallion. The cars were delivered to the front, Tupac went with Suge, and Frank Alexander ended up driving Keisha’s car, with no gas, and supposedly no weapon. They headed to Suge Knight’s Las Vegas residence on Monte Rosa Avenue. They stayed there until after 10pm when they left towards Club 662 at 1700 East Flamingo Road. Suge and Tupac were driving with Suge at the wheel of a newly purchased 1996 black 760 BMW sedan. They were cruising down the strip playing Makaveli when at 11:05pm they were stopped for playing the stereo too loud and not displaying proper plates. Of interesting note, is that the shooting took place just after the police stopped them, and this time may well have been used to plan the timing of the drive-by shooting. After they were let go Suge and Tupac headed East on Flamingo road where they stopped for a red light at Koval Lane, half mile from the Strip. One car pulled up a car-length ahead to the right and Kadafi, Frank and EDI were in the car behind them. A jeep full of girls pulled up to the left and got Suge and Tupac’s attention, and that’s when it happened.</div>

<p>
<div justify>A late-model Cadillac with four men inside pulled up directly to the right of the BMW and sprayed 13 rounds into the car. Police reported that a .45 was shot, but it’s believed that information was withheld to identify the real shooter; apparently a .9mm was used. Tupac saw it going down and tried to jump into the back seat. He was hit twice, one bullet hit him his leg and ricocheted up into his lung. Suge was hit in the head with a piece of shrapnel. There were reports that gunfire was returned, but this has been debated and has not been verified completely. The Cadillac turned right onto Koval Lane and vanished. Some cars in the entourage tried to follow the Cadillac but it seemingly disappeared.</div> 
<p>
<div align =justify>Suge meanwhile, pulled a u-turn and headed back down East Flamingo. Suge reportedly told Tupac that he was going to get him to a hospital. The u-turn was questionable because the Desert Springs Hospital is located at 2075 East Flamingo, not far from club 662. Suge knows the area all to well as he used to play for the UNLV Rebels. The cops turned and followed Suge down the road instead of securing the crime scene. As a result the scene and evidence was ran over and dispersed through traffic. Three cars from their entourage also followed Suge down East Flamingo. Suge got caught up in traffic, went up over a median, ran a red light and popped a couple tires on the center divider. He ran the red light at Harmon Avenue and then got stuck on the median with four flat tires. Police, ambulance and the fire department arrived on the scene that was in total chaos. Reports were made of people running up trying to snatch side-mirrors and such off of the car. Tupac’s entourage was ordered to get on the ground and held at gunpoint while Tupac was loaded into an ambulance and taken to University Medical Center.</div>

<div align =justify>Tupac remained at the intensive care unit while family and friends had a vigil at the hospital. When I found out Tupac had been shot I was shocked, I really wasn’t expecting it. I said “yeah, just wait till he comes this time, he’s gonna be really pissed.” The thought that Tupac could have died really didn’t occur to me at first, he always seemed larger than life. While in the hospital Tupac had his right lung removed, he was in and out of consciousness and was highly sedated. Later he was placed on a ventilator and respirator, life-support, and put into a drug-induced coma. The doctor made a promising statement that Tupac had passed the critical phase and had a fifty percent chance of survival. Considering the odds Tupac had been faced with through out life and had always succeeded, a fifty percent chance seemed like a certainty. Unfortunately they couldn’t stop the internal bleeding and Tupac passed. After several attempts to revive him, his mother Afeni, decided to let him rest. “I really felt it was important for Tupac, who fought so hard, to have a free spirit. I felt it was important for his spirit to be allowed to be free. So I rejoiced with him, with the release of his spirit.” On September, Friday the 13th, the always-lively Tupac had breathed his last breath...</div>
