<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Internet is a public collaboration. No one person, organization, or
group of organizations owns it. As it grew from a small network of
four computers used in research for the United States defense
establishment into a public system comprised of hundreds of
commercial telecommunication networks of all sizes, thousands of
institutions, hundreds of thousands of businesses, and millions of
individual users. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Since the Internet started,
it has opened a wide amount of information available to us at the
touch of a button. The main question that everyone asks is “<I>Who
owns the Internet”?</I> Although the Internet is available to
anyone who has access to it, someone must own the copyright for it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Originally the Internet was
the brainchild of the Department of Defence to communicate with one
another during the war. Then researchers began to use it to share
research data and information in the Universities in America. As far
as i know, nobody has ever claimed copyright for it. Even though it
is now in the process of being locked over and being used as global
communication.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The
most obvious candidates for ownership in the future are some of the
major software companies led by the most obvious and most pervasive,
Microsoft, which provides 75 percent of the operating systems
controlling PC computers. Microsoft virtually holds the keys to the
kingdom. Apple Computer, whose software many devoted users consider
far more versatile and useful, seems to be losing market share,
although Apple claims about 21 percent of those having access to the
Internet. There are, of course, other candidates: Sun Microsystems
with its Java aplets and a strong software and hardware position in
the server market; or Netscape with its Navigator that now captures
84 percent of the browser market. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>I
suppose when people think of the Internet they think of Microsoft or
Bill Gates because they are the main people involved in the Internet.
Not many people know that is was used in the war.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>You
could say in a way that the original founders. The USA government,
are the owners of the Internet in a way. They provided the know how
and everyone else took it from there and expanded it as they saw fit.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It seems that everyone
in their own way owns a piece of the Internet. People copyright their
own websites and web pages.</FONT> 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In turn we will never really know who created the
Internet. It was used during the war so the inventors probably wanted
to keep a low profile. Its mainly associated with the USA so maybe we
should be thanking them in a way for the invention. It has clearly
helped mankind in a range of things From communication to business.
It also helped create jobs and improved peoples knowledge of the
world. Various Internet sites are still unable to determine who is
the true developer of the net.</P>
