Internet as we know it today is a</SPAN><FONT SIZE=3>n electronic
network of computers that includes nearly every university,
government, and research facility in the world. Also included are
many commercial sites. It started with four interconnected computers
in 1969 and was known as ARPAnet which was developed by the Advanced
Research Projects Agency or ARPA a U.S <SPAN LANG="en-US">Military</SPAN>
agency. President Eisenhower requested funds in the airforce
appropriations bill because of the treat of <SPAN LANG="en-US">nuclear</SPAN>
warfare and the fear that a well placed strike would completely
destroy the Military's Strategy computer system which up until then
had consisted of a few big computers in the same location.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">ARPA's</SPAN>
main agenda was the decentralization of the Military's strategy
computer system they did this by building several smaller computers
all connected together so that if one machine was destroyed the
system would still function. This got the ball rolling, and the
<SPAN LANG="en-US">concept</SPAN> of different computers at different
locations sharing information over a network soon became a fast
growing reality thanks to technology developed by professor Len
Kleinrock namely Packet Switching (where information is divided into
packets before sending, each packet is sent individually and is then
recompiled into the original message when it reaches it destination)
this was the technology used for two computers to talk to each other
in the first network experiment in 1965 at MIT directed by Larry
Roberts and is the underpinning for the way we send information over
the Internet today. </FONT>

benefits this new <SPAN LANG="en-US">communications</SPAN> system had
led to systems being installed in <SPAN LANG="en-US">university's</SPAN>
all over the U.S. The first E-mail programs called SNDMSG and
READMAIL where developed by Ray Tomlinson at BBN for ARPAnet in 1972
and by 1973 the first international connections the the network where
set up University College London and NORSAR in Norway. </FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>As the
volume of information being sent over the network grew there became a
need for a  set of rules which define how information would be sent
over the network these were developed by Vint Cerf and Bob kahn in
1974 originally TCP (<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">T</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">ransmission
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">C</SPAN>ontrol <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">P</SPAN>rotocol)
which would later be split in 1978  into TCP/IP (Internet Protocol) .
IP is <SPAN LANG="en-US">responsible</SPAN> for the information 
being sent from server to server based on a destination address the
IP number which every computer must have to be able to to send
information over the network while TCP is used to make sure the
correct information reaches it destination it can detect errors in
the data and will resend until the data is correctly <SPAN LANG="en-US">received.</SPAN>
