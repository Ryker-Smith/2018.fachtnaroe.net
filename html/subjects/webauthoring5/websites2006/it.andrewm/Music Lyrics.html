[Intro- 50 Cent]
Yeah
Shady
Aftermath<p>

[Chorus- 50 Cent]
I know somethin' you didn't know
I make you beg for more
Everybody's on the floor
Goin', goin' outta control<p>

[Bridge- 50 Cent]
Set it off from your left dawg
Set it off from your right dawg
Set it off nigga I said set <p>

[Verse 1]
Sick with it boy, better get wit it what
In the club, I get it goin' goin' uhh
Just move it to the music its on
To the sound of 50 MPRE
Everythings calculated in time percised
Never move another mill let's get right aight
This test is my ?? choice I'm high off life
Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you wanna do
Hit the dance floor, move how you wanna move
Later on, we can cruise if you wanna cruise
Its whatever you want, the fact is I got more than I flaunt<p>

[Chorus- 50 Cent]
I did my thang in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dance floor, jam-packed
I got 'em goin', goin' outta control<p>

[Bridge- 50 Cent]
Set it off from your left dawg
Set if off from your right dawg
Set it off nigga I said set it off<p>

[Verse 2]
System thumpin', dance floor jumpin'
We thirty deep in this bitch, we stuntin'
Thats what you get, you in my hood
I thought you understood
You know me, VIP, no ID
Bottles in DP, I do it real BIG
Bitches break their necks to be where I be<p>



Take 'em to ecstacy without ecstacy
I'm the chef, you need a hit, I got the recipe
Doc got the antedote and send the drugs in the nose
Can you feel it, Slim said for me to make ya feel it
And remind you that you rockin' with the realest<p>

[Chorus- 50 Cent]
I did my thang in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dance floor, jam-packed
I got 'em goin', goin' outta control<p>

[Bridge- 50 Cent]
Set it off from your left dawg
Set it off from your right dawg
Set it off nigga I said set it off<p>

[Verse 3]
I'm hot boy, I'm burnin' up
I do my thang in the club with the burner tounge
Till the speakers all blown we gon' turn it up
And do that damn thang, yeah do that mayn
Shorty, hit me high, then hit me low
Get to poppin' and shakin' that thang on the flo'
A little dose of it, now I want some more
No body put that thang on me like that before
I be a fiend for it, its the way you move
But I ain't payin' for it, cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I'll stay with it
Hit the telly, play wit it, in a major way get it<p>

[Chorus- 50 Cent]
I did my thang in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dance floor, jam-packed
I got 'em goin', goin' outta control<p>

[Bridge- 50 Cent]
Set if off from your left dawg
Set it off from your right dawg
Set it off nigga I said set it off<p><p><p><p>

Title: 	Candy Shop<p>


feat. Olivia

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah...
Uh huh
So seductive<p>

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
[50 Cent]
I take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollypop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah)<p>
[Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah)<p>

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You can have it your way, how do you want it
You gon' back that thing up or should i push up on it
Temperature rising, okay lets go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a teakettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I'll be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin you 'bout how sprung I gotcha
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem
Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider
I'm a seasons vet when it come to this shit
After you broke up a sweat you can play with the stick
I'm tryin to explain baby the best way I can<p>



I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hands (ha ha)<p>

[Chorus]<p>

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Olivia]
Girl what we do (what we do)
And where we do (and where we do)
The things we do (things we do)
Are just between me and you (oh yeah)<p>

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch em in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she wind
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As Long as she ain't stoppin, homie I aint stoppin
Drippin wet with sweat man its on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone<p>


[Chorus 2x]<p><p><p>

[Verse 1]
Damn baby all I need is a lil bit
A lil bit of this, a lil bit of that
Get it crackin' in the club when you hear this shit
Drop it like its hot, get to workin' that back
Go shake that thang, yeah work that thang
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
Can you make it go round and round
I step up in the club, I'm like who you with
G-Unit in the house, yeah thats my clique
Yeah I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dance floor, a nigga doin' old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up, boy I done warned you
Better listen, when I talk, nigga don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mine's in this bitch
I ain't tryna beef, I'm tryna get my drink on
Got my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'ma kick it at the bar till its time to go
Then I'ma get shorty here and I'ma let her know<p>

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl just a lil bit
We can head to the crib in a lil bit
I can show ya how I live in a lil bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down a lil bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and ?? a lil bit<p>

[Verse 2]
This is 50, comin' out your stereos
Hard to tell though, cause I switched the flow
Eyes a lil low, cause I twist the dro'
Pockets on ?? cause I move the O's<p>




My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get ya bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Now captain come on and save a hoe
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart, all the time mayn
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dance floor packed, thats without a doubt
And shorty shake that thang like a pro mayn
She back it up on me I'm like oh mayn
I get close enough to her so I know she can hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear<p>

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl just a lil bit
We can head to the crib in a lil bit
I can show ya how I live in a lil bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down a lil bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and ?? a lil bit<p>

[Bridge]
Baby you got me feelin' right (ya heard me)
My mama gone, you can spend the night (ya heard me)
I ain't playin', I'ma tryna ?? tonight (ya heard me)
Clothes off, face down, x up, c'mon<p>

[Chorus x2]
All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl just a lil bit
We can head to the crib in a lil bit
I can show ya how I live in a lil bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down a lil bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and ?? a lil b<p>

[50 Cent]<p>
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go shawty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!<p>

[Chorus] (2x)<p>
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed<p>

[Verse]
When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya im loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind<p>




Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go<p>

[Chorus] (2x)<p>

[Bridge]<p>
My flow, my show brought me the doe
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look nigga I got K-Mart and I ain't change<p>

[Verse]<p>
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumpin in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub
You know where we fucking be<p>

[Chorus] (2x)<p>

[Talking]<p>
(laughing) Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either nigga
In the club all the time nigga, its about to pop off nigga

(Chorus)<p>
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P<p>
(Repeat)<p>

(Verse 1)<p>
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars<p>
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna
I spit a little G man, and my game got her
A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can't see
You fucking with me, you fucking with a P-I-M-P<p>

(Chorus)<p>

(Verse 2)<p>
I'm bout my money you see, girl you can holla at me
If you fucking with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me, if you curious to see
how it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all<p>




We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up, if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, BITCH<p>

(Chorus)<p>

(Verse 3)<p>
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shiiit, TRICK<p>

(Chorus)<p>

Yeah, in Hollywoood they say there's no b'ness like show b'ness
In the hood they say, there's no b'ness like hoe b'ness ya know
They say I talk a lil fast, but if you listen a lil faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, BITCH<p><p>

[Intro]<p>
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh<p>

[Verse 1- 50 Cent]<p>
Comin' up I was confused, my mama kissin' a girl
Confusin' occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, prolly out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a fo' ring ring, one of them gold ropes
Nanna told me if I pass I'll get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep at night
Woke up the next mornin' niggas done stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could<p>

[Chorus x2- 50 Cent (Then Game)]<p>
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops<p>

Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me<p>

[Verse 2- The Game]<p>
I told Dre from the gate, I carry the heat fo' ya
First mixtape song, I inheirited beef fo' ya
Gritted my teeth fo' ya, G-G-G'd fo ya
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold
And had the whole crowd yellin' free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
Before I creep and turn ya projects into Collumbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind ya'll what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us, cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth<p>

[Chorus x2- 50 Cent (Then Lloyd Banks)]<p>
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops<p>

Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me<p>

[Bridge- 50 Cent]<p>
From the beginnin' to end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend<p>



The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would chane
But its stayin' the same<p>

[Verse 3- Lloyd Banks]<p>
How many of them boys is with ya
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walkin' with a snub, cause niggas do a lotta slip talkin' in the club
Till they coughin' on the rug, ain't never had much but a walkman and a bub
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug, bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat, now its a ?? in my coat
Now I'm ?? reminiscin', holdin' my weed in never listen
If I see him an ?? and maybe that'll even the score
And if not, then that'll be me on the floor<p>

[Chorus x2- 50 Cent (Then Tony Yayo)]<p>
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops<p>

Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me<p>

[Verse 4- Tony Yayo]<p>
I started out at fifteen, scared as hell
I took thirty off a pack and I made them sell
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that little duece duece and my triple fat goose
Sippin' easy Jesus rockin' the laces
Mama with me and when she found my pieces
I look back on life and think God I bless
We the best on the planet so forget the rest<p[>

[Verse 5- Young Buck]<p>
You know I'm still nice with my cooked game
Look mayn, its a hood thang thats why I'm loved in Brooklayn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, homie I'm still all good
Let me show what a thug that born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 and put 'em in my four five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen awards to check bitch<p>

[Chorus x2- 50 Cent (Then Young Buck)]<p>
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops<p>

Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me<p><p>

(Like the fire needs the air)
(I won't burn unless your there)<p>

Yea, I need you,I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
you know, its real shit, feel this!<p>

[Verse 1]<p>
America's got a thing for this gangsta's shit, they love me
Black Chucks, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take spills over raymo shit, I'ma fan
Got through the silver duck tape on my trait old handle
The women on my life bring confusion shit
SO like Nino from New Jack, I'll have to cancel that bitch
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze up
Yo the empire on the low the narc's don't know I'm the weatherman
I take that coke leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homey I'm just triple beam, dreamin
Niggaz be schemin, I'm fiendin to live a good life
The fiends just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me<p>

[Chorus]<p>
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way when while I'm tryin to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want to find the thing thats in my life
So I hustle (hustle)<p>

[Verse 2]<p>
Yea, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black talents start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my cold days, they called me chef boy are 50<p>




Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed shit
Send me them seeds i'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And I'm sellin them 500 a pop god damn it
I sold everythin I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA recrock<p>

What goes in my mind, its contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If the rap was the block or spider, I'll be poke and butter
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin money man<p>

[Chorus]<p>

[Verse 3]<p>
Its a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
In the jewels with your chains
I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Played it perf and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them holi tip bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he don't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey they can't stop me
Racist, pointin at me look at the nigga ratchi
Hello!<p>
