This Website is a tribute to the great bassist Jaco Pastorius. Jaco born John Francis Pastorius III (December 1, 1951 - September 21, 1987) was a jazz bassist and composer, notable for his virtuoso technique and playing style.

His big influence on the modern electric bass is widely touted, as he was responsible for the popularization of fretless electric bass. 
He introduced a textural approach and harmonic sense to bass playing that became the signature "Jaco" sound. 
His career was cut short due to problems with drugs and depression, 
but his technique and style have profoundly influenced bassists both in jazz and in other genres.
