did the Internet come from?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The United States
Military started the Internet in the 1960's. It was used as a
computer network for thousands of government employees around the
world to communicate. Science and Technology researchers were the
first non-military users of the Internet. In the early 1990's the
government changed polices that restricted private and business uses
of the Internet. By 1992 dozens of new companies offered direct
Internet access to individuals. <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">(1)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The ancestor of the
Internet was the ARPANET, a project funded by the U.S. Department of
Defense (DOD) in 1969. The ARPANET was both an experiment in reliable
networking and an effort to link DOD and military research
contractors, including the large number of universities doing
military-funded research. (ARPA stands for Advanced Research Projects
Administration, the branch of the DOD in charge of handing out grant
money. For enhanced confusion, the agency is now known as DARPA --
the added D is for Defense, in case anyone had doubts about where the
money was coming from.) Although the ARPANET started small,
connecting three computers in California with one in Utah, it quickly
grew to span the continent.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The reliable networking
part involved dynamic routing. If one of the network links became
disrupted by enemy attack, the traffic on it could be rerouted
automatically to other links. Fortunately, the Net rarely has come
under enemy attack. Cutting a cable during road construction (known
in the biz as backhoe fade) is just as much of a threat, however, so
it's important for the Net to be backhoe-resistant. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Because the ARPANET was
wildly successful, every university in the country wanted to sign up.
This success meant that the ARPANET began getting difficult to
manage, particularly with the large and growing number of university
sites on it. It was broken into two parts: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Beginning around 1980,
university computing was moving from a small number of large
time-sharing machines, each of which served hundreds of simultaneous
users, to a large number of smaller desktop workstations for
individual users. Because users had gotten used to the advantages of
time-sharing systems, such as shared directories of files and e-mail,
they wanted to keep those same facilities on their workstations.
(They were perfectly happy to leave behind the disadvantages of
time-shared systems. A sage once said, &quot;The best thing about a
workstation is that it's no faster in the middle of the night.&quot;)
Most of the new workstations ran a variety of UNIX, a popular (and,
for many versions, free or close to it) type of operating software
that had been developed at AT&amp;T and the University of California
at Berkeley. The people at Berkeley had a government contract to
improve computer networking, so their version of UNIX included all
the software necessary to hook up to a network. Because workstation
manufacturers also began to include the necessary network hardware,
all you had to do to get a working network was to string the cable to
connect the workstations, something that universities could do for
cheap because they usually could get students to do it.  <FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">(2)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">By the mid-1980s there
was a significant market for Internet-based products. In the 1990s we
started to see commercial services showing up, a direct consequence
of the NSFNet initiative, which started in 1986 as a 56 Kbps network
based on LSI-11s with software developed by David Mills, who was at
the University of Delaware. Mills called his NSFNet nodes
&quot;Fuzzballs.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The NSFNet, which was
originally designed to hook supercomputers together, was quickly
outstripped by demand and was overhauled for T1. IBM, Merit, and MCI
did this, with IBM developing the router software. Len Bozack was the
Stanford student who started Cisco Systems. His first client:
Hewlett-Packard. Meanwhile Proteon had gotten started, and a number
of other routing vendors had emerged. Despite having built the first
gateways (now called routers), BBN didn't believe there was a market
for routers, so they didn't go into competition with Wellfleet, ACC,
Bridge, 3COM, Cisco, and others. The exponential growth of the
Internet began in 1986 with the NSFNet. When the NCP to TCP
transition occurred in 1983 there were only a couple of hundred
computers on the network. As of January 1993 there are over 1.3
million computers in the system. There were only a handful of
networks back in 1983; now there are over 10,000.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1988 I made a
conscious decision to pursue connection of the Internet to commercial
electronic mail carriers. It wasn't clear that this would be
acceptable from the standpoint of federal policy, but I thought that
it was important to begin exploring the question. By 1990, an
experimental mail relay was running at the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives (CNRI) linking MCI Mail with the Internet. In
the intervening two years, most commercial email carriers in the U.S.
are linked to Internet and many others around the world are following
suit.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In this same time period,
commercial Internet service providers emerged from the collection of
intermediate-level networks inspired and sponsored by the National
Science Foundation as part of its NSFNet initiatives. Performance
Systems International (PSI) was one of the first, spinning off from
NYSERNet. UUNET Technologies formed Alternet; Advanced Network and
Systems (ANS) was formed by IBM, MERIT, and MCI (with its ANS CO+RE
commercial subsidiary); CERFNet was initiated by General Atomics
which also runs the San Diego Supercomputer Center; JVNCNet became
GES, Inc., offering commercial services; Sprint formed Sprintlink;
Infonet offered Infolan service; the Swedish PTT offered SWIPNET, and
comparable services were offered in the UK and Finland. The
Commercial Internet exchange was organized by commercial Internet
service providers as a traffic transfer point for unrestricted
service.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In 1990 a conscious
effort was made to link in commercial and nonprofit information
service providers, and this has also turned out to be useful. Among
others, Dow Jones, Telebase, Dialog, CARL, the National Library of
Medicine, and RLIN are now online. <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">(3) </FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now it's today and here
we are. Commercial activity on the Net is continuing its
unprecedented growth, but that certainly hasn't hurt the scientific,
educational, and research networks (which are also growing by leaps
and bounds.) The Internet--a combination of the NSFnet, ARPAnet, the
CIX, and about 10,000 other networks--will continue to grow and
change, meeting the needs of the people who want it, no matter what
they use it for. <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">(4)</FONT></P>
