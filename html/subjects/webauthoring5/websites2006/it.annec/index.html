Internet started in America in the 60s for military purposes, the
Americans were frightened of attack from the Russians, there were
very few computers at this time, they were so big they would fill
whole rooms, one well planned attack could easily destroy the whole
US military system. They decided to build a computer system
consisting of several small computers all connected together so that
if one machine was destoyed the other ones would be ok. It was
initially called ARPANET. Eventually more and more computers were
connecting to this network and  it began to grow, networks were also
developing in other countries and they eventually joined, the
Internet as it became known at this time shot up. In 1969 there was
only 4 computers connected to the Internet and to date there are 9.5
million!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT SIZE=3>Although
the US were responsible for the setting up of the Internet, they do
not actually own the Internet, no one person or organisation actually
owns it, in fact the only logical solution is that <I>Everybody </I>owns
their own piece. There are however organisations that do oversee what
happens on the Internet and assign ip addresses and domain names,
such as the National Science Foundation, Icann and Internic. The
Internet became a fast and very effective way of communication,
knowledge could be shared in a very short space of time. In 1972<I>
Ray Tomlinson</I> created the email program, this was a massive step
in making the Internet what it is today. Emails are a fast way of
communicating with anyone anywhere in the world but rules must be
followed while using emails, security is a major issue with emails
and one must always bare in mind that an email may be read by a
number of people as well as the person it was sent to. Other means of
communication over the Internet  to name two are Msn and Yahoo, these
are real time methods of communication which allow you to talk to
anyone again any where in the world. Although the Internet allowed
people to share information with eachother very quickly, the
information was not always correct.</FONT></FONT></P>

1990 <I>Tim Berners-Lee </I>created the World Wide Web at Cern, a
meeting place for physicists from all over the world. It was a system
of text links and multimedia capabilities that made the Internet
accessible to mass audiences.  The World Wide Web became available on
the Internet in 1991. It was a long awaited database of information,
with a click of a mouse pages of information were now available and
the user could quickly find the exact information they required. The
Internet  has been designed so that it can never be broken, because
it is a network of networks, the fact of its original design makes it
impossible.To break the Internet every computer all over the world
would have to be destroyed, if one remained the Internet would be
intact. Therefore because it would be virtually impossible to destroy
all computers In my opinion the Internet cannot be broken.</FONT></FONT></P>
