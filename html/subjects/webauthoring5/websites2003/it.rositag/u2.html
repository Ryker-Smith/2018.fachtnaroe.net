<P><H1>BLOODY SUNDAY</H1>


<P> I can't believe the news today
<P> Oh, I can't close my eyes
<P> And make it go away
<P>How long...
<P> How long must we sing this song?
<P> How long? How long...
<P> 'cause tonight...we can be as one
<P>Tonight...

<P>Broken bottles under children's feet
<P> Bodies strewn across the dead end street
<P> But I won't heed the battle call
<P>It puts my back up  Puts my back up against the wall

<P>Sunday, Bloody Sunday
<P>Sunday, Bloody Sunday
<P>Sunday, Bloody Sunday


<P>And the battle's just begun
<P>There's many lost, but tell me who has won
<P>The trench is dug within our hearts
<P>And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
<P>Torn apart

<P> Sunday, Bloody Sunday
<P> Sunday, Bloody Sunday

<P> How long...
<P> How long must we sing this song?
<P> How long? How long...
<P> 'cause tonight...we can be as one
<P> Tonight...tonight...

<P> Sunday, Bloody Sunday
<P> Sunday, Bloody Sunday

<P> Wipe the tears from your eyes
<P> Wipe your tears away
<P> Oh, wipe your tears away
<P> Oh, wipe your tears away
<P> (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
<P> Oh, wipe your blood shot eyes
<P> (Sunday, Bloody Sunday

<P> Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
<P> Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)

<P> And it's true we are immune
<P> When fact is fiction and TV reality
<P> And today the millions cry

<P> We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

<P> (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)

<P> The real battle just begun
<P> To claim the victory Jesus won
<P> On...

<P> Sunday Bloody Sunday
<P> Sunday Bloody Sunday...
