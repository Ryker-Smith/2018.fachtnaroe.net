<P><LI>When was the Inquiry set up?

<P>The Bloody Sunday Inquiry was announced by the Prime Minister Tony Blair in a statement to the House of Commons on 29 January 1998.

<P><LI>Why was the Inquiry set up?
<P>The basis for the current Inquiry is that there is new evidence, which was not available to Lord Widgery. The weight of new material available is such that the events of 30 January 1972 require re-examination.

<P><LI>What is the Inquiry s status?
<P>The Inquiry is set up under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921.This means the Tribunal has the same legal powers as the High Court to require individuals to attend before it and to provide documents.

<P><LI>Who is leading the Inquiry?
<P>The Inquiry is being conducted by an international tribunal of judges, chaired by the Right Hon Lord Saville of Newdigate. The other Tribunal members are the Honourable William L. Hoyt (formerly Chief Justice of New Brunswick, Canada) and the Honourable John L. Toohey (former Justice of the High Court of Australia).

<P><LI>Is this a trial?
<P>No, this is an Inquiry not a trial.It is inquisitorial not adversarial.The Tribunal takes the initiative in trying to ascertain the truth.Unlike an adversarial contest, it is for the Tribunal to seek all the relevant material.Its task is not to decide in favour of one party or another. Indeed, from the point of view of the Tribunal, there are no parties or sides. There will be those who have material evidence to give or who have a legitimate interest in challenging such evidence, but the Tribunal will not treat them as sides or parties in an adversarial contest. The inquisitorial format is a means of seeking out the truth in a way that would not 0.be possible in adversarial proceedings.

<P><LI>When and where is the Tribunal holding its hearings?
<P>The Inquiry resumed oral hearings on Monday 2 September 2002 for three weeks in the Guildhall, Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Since Tuesday 24 September the oral hearings have been held in the Central Hall, Westminster, LondonIt may be necessary to return to Derry from time to time.The oral hearings will normally run from 9:30-12:00hrs and 12:45-15:00hrs, Monday to Thursday, although it is not unusual for sessions to run on longer and the days may vary on occasion, for example, to accommodate a Bank Holiday.

<P><LI>Why have the hearings moved from Londonderry to Central London?
<P>In December 2001 the Court of Appeal ruled that the evidence of the soldier witnesses should not be taken in Londonderry on the grounds that they have reasonable fears for their safety. The Tribunal concluded that for this part of the evidence the Inquiry hearings should move to Great Britain.On 14 March the Inquiry announced that the venue for the hearings would be Central Hall, Westminster.

<P><LI>Is the Inquiry going to be completed in London?
<P>No. Once the evidence of the soldiers - and any other witnesses who have successfully applied to give their evidence in London - is heard, the Inquiry will return to Derry for the final sessions.

<P><LI>Who are the witnesses?
<P>The Inquiry has interviewed and received statements from over 1,700 civilians, clergymen, journalists, photographers and soldiers.A large proportion of these have been or will be called to give evidence at the hearings.

<P><LI>What is the running order of the witnesses?
<P>The majority of witnesses drawn from civilians, priests, media and former-RUC have been heard. From here on, it is expected that the Inquiry will hear mainly from soldiers, politicians, and Government officials. In addition the Inquiry has heard from three experts from the fields of pathology and ballistics.

<P><LI>Which parties have legal representation?
<P>Although this is an inquisitorial inquiry and not an adversarial contest, the Tribunal has allowed the families of those who died on Bloody Sunday, those who were wounded that day, and soldiers to be represented. They are represented by various different firms of solicitors and the Treasury Solicitor. In addition, a number of individuals have been granted a measure of legal representation.

<P><LI>Who will question the witnesses?
<P>Normally questions will be put to witnesses by Counsel to the Inquiry. When appropriate, subject to the discretion of the Tribunal, questions maybe put by Counsel for the interested parties. The Tribunal may also question some witnesses.

<P><LI>What is screening ?
<P>In some instances witnesses can be screened while giving their evidence. This means that they are only visible to the tribunal, counsel and other legal representatives. Members of the public and media can hear the evidence being delivered but will not be able to see the witness while this is done.It is up to the Tribunal to decide whether an application for screening should be granted.

<P><LI>Are screened witnesses giving evidence anonymously?
<P>No. Although they are screened from view during hearings, the witness s name is in the public domain. Applications for anonymity are separate. Witnesses who are giving evidence anonymously can also apply to be screened. Again, it is up to the Tribunal to make a decision on these applications.

<P><LI>Why are some of the military witnesses being granted anonymity?
<P>This is being done for security reasons. The Tribunal ruled in October 1999 that all soldiers whose identity is not already clearly in the public domain will not be identified in the course of the Inquiry's proceedings unless the Tribunal directs or rules otherwise. This gives effect to the judgement of the Court of Appeal in 28 July 1999. <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> For more information on this see the 13 October 1999 press notice this can be found on the Inquiry website www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></b></p>

<P><LI>Have any witnesses been granted immunity from prosecution?
<P>No. However, the Attorney General has stipulated that any written material or oral evidence provided by a witness cannot be used to incriminate that witness in any later criminal proceedings. It is considered essential that in order to reach the truth of what happened on Bloody Sunday witnesses do not refuse to co-operate on the grounds that they may incriminate themselves. This does not rule out the possibility of future criminal proceedings against an individual, only that their own evidence to the Bloody Sunday Inquiry cannot be used against them.

<P><LI>Will the public have access to documents referred to at the hearings?
<P>Unless the Tribunal directs otherwise, all documents put in evidence will be displayed on screens in the main hall and wherever there is CCTV coverage of the proceedings so that the press and public can see them. Documents referred to in any witness statements will be placed on the Inquiry website within two hours of the conclusion of the days business. The Inquiry does not have the resources to provide hard copies of these documents to the public on demand. Limited exceptions may be made, at the discretion of the Inquiry staff, in order to assist journalists reporting the proceedings or for other good reason.<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Transcripts and statements are available on the Inquiry s website: <a href="http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Albertus (W1)&quot;;"> www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org</span></a> within two-hours of the close of business each day.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
