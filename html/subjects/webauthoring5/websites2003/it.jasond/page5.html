<H1>Weight gain Vs smoking</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>To stop smoking is challenge enough but some smokers dread the possibility of gaining weight.  If you fall into the latter camp, the following information may help put the situation into perspective and allay some fears.

<P>Smoking suppresses the appetite and therefore you may feel hungrier when you quit smoking.  Eating more of the wrong foods will, most likely, make you gain weight.
Nicotine also speeds up the body’s processes, so when you stop smoking your body needs less energy, but if you are giving it more (in the form of calories) this can lead to weight gain.  Don’t let this become a reason for not quitting smoking.
Many smokers are in fact underweight due to prolonged appetite suppression and of those who do put on weight, about half increase their weight by less than two kilos.

<P><U>How to Avoid Weight Gain:</U>

<P>It is important to remember that not all ex-smokers put on weight.
If you do have concerns about gaining weight talk to your doctor or a dietician and develop a sensible eating plan.

<P><U>Product aids:</U>

<P>Stop smoking aids can help you in your efforts to quit smoking.  If you try and fail, what help should you seek and what products should you consider?

<P>Help is all you should hope for, to quit smoking and succeed you need a deep desire to stop.  If you use products that help you to achieve your goal, you aren’t any less of a person.
When you try to stop it helps if everything goes right, stress and temptation are kept to a minimum and you get the right support from your doctor, family and friends.  If you find you are failing for any particular reason, quitting aids might be a suitable solution.


<P><U>Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)</U>

<P>Nicotine patches, gum, inhalers and nasal sprays all fall into this category.  They are designed to help by weaning you off nicotine gradually.  Giving you nicotine to help with withdrawal without all the tar, carbon monoxide and other harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke.
NRT is available over the counter except the nasal spray, which you can get on prescription from your doctor.  It is important that with all of these you seek advice from your doctor if you have health problems.  Read the packaging carefully and ask advice from your chemist if in doubt.

<P><U>Zyban (Bupropion)</U>

<P>Zyban is available through prescription only.  This drug comes in tablet form and no one is really sure how it works other than to say that it works on chemicals in the brain.  There has been a great deal of success with Zyban but there is much controversy over its side effects, the main ones seem to be insomnia, dry mouth and dizziness, followed by nausea, constipation, anxiety, disturbed concentration and rhinitis.

<P><U>Smoke-No-More</U>

<P>Mouthwash, Oral Spray and St John’s Wort.  An effective range of products that compliment quitting smoking cold turkey.  The mouthwash and spray simply serve as a reminder of your quitting effort but smoking becomes extremely unpleasant if attempted.  St John’s Wort is commonly regarded as an effective natural aid for dealing with anxiety and stress.

<P><U>Other Products and Remedies</U>

<P>I have heard testimonies from many smokers who have quit using alternative therapies such as hypnosis and acupuncture and swear by them.  The following tips should help you in assessing whether or not a program is of use to you:
Be sensible and do not fall for wild claims. There is no magic or wonder cure. These products can assist you in your efforts and no more.
Whichever method you choose to help you need a deep desire to stop. Don’t give up on giving up.  If at first you don’t succeed…
Take a break; evaluate what you need to do differently. Remember, try, try, and try again…<P>
