<P>Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known to man.  Powerful and very fast acting.  This is the chemical which causes addiction to cigarettes.
It is a drug and has many different effects on the body at the same time. After just one puff it begins to act on your central nervous system, even though it makes you feel relaxed.

Over time as you continue to smoke, your body learns to depend on nicotine.  As a result when you stop smoking you get ‘nicotine cravings’ one of many different withdrawal symptoms.

<P>Nicotine Cravings and Withdrawal Symptoms when you quit smoking are a common experience.
It is the way your body reacts when it stops getting nicotine and all the other chemicals in tobacco smoke.
Some withdrawal symptoms will come and go over a period of a few days.  Most are gone within three weeks and not every smoker is affected to the same degree.

<P>Cravings.  Each one lasts 3-5 minutes, and may be strong.  Over time however, cravings will happen less often.
Headaches (occasional), indigestion, nausea, insomnia, diarrhoea and sore throats rarely last more than four days.
Try usual over the counter remedies for these symptoms.
Tea and coffee contain caffeine and, without nicotine, your body absorbs much more of this stimulant, which can make you restless, irritable and sleepless for a while.
Try drinking less tea and coffee, make your cups weaker.
Irritability, depression, tiredness, lack of concentration or anxiety are closely connected to the physical action of nicotine leaving your body and will lessen over one to three weeks.
Try and relax more during the first few weeks, any tiredness will pass.
Take a break from what you’re doing and take a short walk if possible to help concentration.
