<P>FOTA Wildlife Park, just 10 miles from Cork on the Cobh road, is among the most modern wildlife parks in Europe.

Established in 1983 with the primary aim of conservation, Fota has more than 70 species of exotic wildlife in open

natural surroundings with no obvious barriers. Giraffes, zebras, ostrich and antelope roam together in 40 acres

of grassland, much as they would in the African savannah, monkeys swing through trees on lake islands,

while kangaroos, macaws and lemurs have complete freedom of the Park. Only the cheetahs have a conventional fence.

<P>FOTA Wildlife Park is not like an ordinary zoo. Wherever possible FOTA have chosen animals that thrive in a

free-range environment, which allows them to roam free, while mixed with other species and with us human visitors! 

These species are also able to adjust to the Irish Climate. The animals themselves make the choice of seeking

shelter when necessary. In some cases, for example the giraffes, only a barrier separates visitors from the

animals but this is always unobtrusive and does not reduce the animals' quality of life.
