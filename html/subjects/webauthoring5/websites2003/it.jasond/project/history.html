<P>Fota Wildlife Park was opened in 1983 by the President of Ireland, Dr. Patrick Hillery and 

is a joint project of the Zoological Society of Ireland and University College, Cork. The

Wildlife Park is a non-profit organisation limited by guarantee, and is a registered charity.

Any financial surpluses that the Park generates are reinvested in order to promote the company's

objectives of conservation, education and research.

Fota Wildlife Park exists because two people independently had the same vision; the late 

Dr. Terry Murphy, then Director of Dublin Zoo and Albert Pope, an architectural student form Cork.

At the time of the Park's original development Fota Island was the Univeristy's farm and the Park's

land is still owned by University College Cork. All the funds for the original development were raised

from public subscription, apart from a grant from Bord Fáilte. Fota Wildlife Park has received over 3 

million visitors.

Fota Island was the former home of the Smith-Barry family, descendants of the Norman's who came to

Ireland in 1185. In those days the family's lands were very extensive but they dwindled over the years

until they were restricted to Fota Island. The estate was finally sold to University College Cork in 1975.

The Smith-Barry's residence, Fota House and its famous gardens and arboretum, are situated next to the 

Wildlife Park. They are run by Fota Trust Ltd with the assistance of the national heritage agency, Dúchas. 

The rest of the island is now owned by the Fota Island Company Ltd and includes the top class Fota 

Island Golf Club.
