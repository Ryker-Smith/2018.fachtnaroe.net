<P><FONT COLOR="YELLOW">Take Care:</FONT><BR>
Much of the Park is accessible to the visitor. However, the animals do not like to be 
harassed and we would encourage you to<BR> 
stay on the paths as much as possible. These paths allow you to see most of the Park without difficulty.

<P><FONT COLOR="YELLOW">Watching Animals:</FONT><BR>
Most animals allow a close approach. Your visit will be most enjoyable if you do not 
try to pet them as this would only frighten them.<BR> If you stand back a short distance 
you will see the animals behaving naturally and calmly.<BR> Of course, chasing the animals 
is forbidden. 

<P><FONT COLOR="YELLOW">Feeding:</FONT><BR>
The animals are fed special diets, in most cases twice a day. We particularly ask you not
to feed the animals as this can damage<BR> their health or even cause their death.
