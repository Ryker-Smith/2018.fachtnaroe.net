<H1>Do you really want to quit?</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>If you want long term success (i.e. to stop smoking and stay stopped) there is only one price to pay; you have to want to quit!  Why?  Well, just for a moment, forget about will power, product aids and programs.  If you attempt to do anything in life half heartedly, the most likely outcome is failure.

<P>It takes far less effort to make a determined effort to stop when you want to do it and you’re in the right frame of mind, than a half-baked attempt when you really don’t want to.  You just can’t get your head around it.

<P>Don’t waste time and effort going through the motions if you don’t want to stop.  It’s like waiting for a bus you know is unreliable to get you somewhere on time – setting yourself up with a lame excuse to blame for failure.  Find real reasons to quit that mean something to you and you will be well on your way.  This is so important, as these reasons will help motivate you through difficult moments of craving, stress, social situations and peer pressure.
