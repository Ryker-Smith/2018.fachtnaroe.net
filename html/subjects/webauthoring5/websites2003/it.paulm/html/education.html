              <h1>Education</h1>

              <p>In 1941 he attended the Colegio Nacional Dean Funes, a secondary school in Cordoba. He excelled only in literature and sports. As a young boy Ernesto loved to play rugby, even more so because of his asthma. He would never quit anything because of his asthma, if anything it made him push harder.</p>

              <p>Even at this early age, it is believed that Ernesto was already reading Marx, Engels and Freud from his father's library.</p>

              <p>In 1947, Ernesto Guevara meets the young Berta Gilda Infante, also known as Tita. She is a member of the Argentine Communistic Youth. They build up a profound friendship and together they read Marxist texts and discuss the actualities.</p>

              <p>Ernesto became fond of Tita, and it is believed that he asked for her hand in marriage as he was leaving on his second journey around South America. She would send him a telegram declining his offer even though she too was very fond of him. It broke his heart, but he would never let it show.</p>

              <p>He later enrolled in the University of Buenos Aries in 1948, where he would study medicine. At first he choose this to better understand his own disease, but later he grew interested in leprosy.</p>

              <p>In 1948, Ernesto, who is 20 years old at that time, undergoes an examination at the faculty of medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. In March he passes for the examinations of the first year, in June for those of the second year and in December for those from the third year.</p>
