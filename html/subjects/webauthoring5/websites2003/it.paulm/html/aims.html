              <h1>Aims</h1>

              <p>Most of us today know at least a little bit about Ernesto ‘El Che’ Guevara, whether it just be his face we saw on a poster or tee shirt, or whether we have seen a documentary or read an article on him. He seems to be everywhere we look.</p>

              <p>But who was Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara, the man, before he became the revolutionary and a heroic symbol to millions around the globe? </p>

              <p>My aim is to research a little into this. To find out whom Ernesto Guevara was, and what started him on the road to becoming the revolutionary. I aim to find out about his childhood and education, his family and hopefully his friends.</p>

              <p>In this report I will not be writing about Che as a revolutionary, even though this was what made him the international figure that he is. I am only looking to research into Ernesto Guevara the man, what he meant to his friends and family, what he done in his spare time and his hobbies and likes.</p>
