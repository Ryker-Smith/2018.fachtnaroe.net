              <h1>Conclusion</h1>

              <p>Ernesto 'El Che' Guevara was a man that no matter what he would have chosen to do in life would have made an impact. He refused to ignore what he felt was wrong and stood up for what he believed was right. This was instilled in him as  a young boy.</p>

              <p>He was a man of conscience. He could not have lived a normal life while the poor people of the southern world suffered, and the rich aristocrats of the imperialist world got rich. Even if he had not become a revolutionary, he would certainly not have being content with simply becoming a Doctor in a General hospital. </p>

              <p>I believe that, had he not chosen to travelled to Cuba and fight in the revolution, he would have continued to travel throughout south America helping the poor, and visit leprosy camps to help out where he could. In his farwell letter to Fidel Castro in 1965 he wrote “Other nations of the world call for my modest efforts.”</p>

              <p>A close friend once said of him “Ernesto was a man concerned for the poor, not a demagogue. He was a symbol of rebellion against hypocrisy, injustice, human suffering and a society without soul “ and this i feel sums up Ernesto.</p>

              <p>Some people have tried to make El Che look more than a man, make him look almost god like, invincible and fearless. These people say that his last words before being kill while held prisoner in Bolivia were “ Shoot Coward, your only going to kill a man”. </p>

              <p>But i feel that these words are were falsely created to build a reputation of hero, a reputation that needs no help in becoming that of a hero.</p>
