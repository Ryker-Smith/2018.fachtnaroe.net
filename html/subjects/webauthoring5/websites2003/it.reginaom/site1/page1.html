<H2>The Introduction of the Death Penalty in America

<P>Britain influenced America’s use of the death penalty more than any other country. When European settlers came to the New World, the brought the practice of capital punishment. The first recorded execution in the New Colonies was that of Captain George Kendall in the Jamestown colony of Virginia in 1608. Kendall was executed for being a spy for Spain.</P>
<P> In 1612, Virginia Governor Sir Thomas Dale enacted the divine, Moral and Martial Laws, which provided the death penalty for even more minor offences such as stealing grapes, killing chickens, and trading with the Indians. Laws regarding the death penalty varied from colony to colony. The Massachusetts Bay Colony held its first execution in 1630, even though the Capital Laws of New England did not go into effect until years later. The New York Colony instituted the Duke’s Laws of 1665. Under these laws, offences such as striking one’s mother or father, or denying the “true God”, were punishable by death.</P>
