<H2>The Death Penalty – An Overview</H2>
<P>In the United States, Congress or any state legislature can prescribe the death penalty or capital punishment for murder and other capital crime. The Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment’s ban on “cruel and unusual punishment”. The sixth Ammendment does not require a jury trial on the sentencing issue of life or death.
</P>
<P>In 1977 the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty was a groosly disportinate punishment for the crime of rape of an adult woman. The Court came to this conclusion by considering the nation’s objective attitude toward the death penalty in rape cases. At the time, only a few states allowed for executions of rapists. More recently, the Supreme Court used the same line of reasoning to rule that the executions of mentally retarded criminals were “cruel and unusual punishments”, that were prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court has established that for death penalty sentencing, the sentencer’s discretion be narrowly guided as to the circumstances that justify imposing the death penalty and that the sentancing process should be individualised.
Not all states provide for the death penalty.</P>
<P>Most states that do employ capital punishment have an age requirement. However, execution of a 16 or 17-year-old killer does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, though the defendant’s age is a
factor for the sentencer to consider.</P>
