<H2>The History of the Death Penalty</H2>
<P>In the 10th century AD, hanging became the usual method of execution in Britain. In the following century, William the Conqueror would not allow persons to be hanged or otherwise executed for any crime, except in times of war. This trend would not last, and in the 16th century, under the reign of Henry VIII, as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed. Some common executions at the time were boiling, burning at the stake, hanging, beheading and drawing and quartering. </P>
<P>Executions were carried out for such capital offences as marrying a Jew, not confessing to a crime, and treason.

The number of crime, and treason.

The number of capital crimes in Britain continued to rise throughout the next two centuries. By the 1700s, 222 crimes were punishable by death in Britain, including stealing, cutting down a tree, and robbing a rabbit warren. Because of the severity of the death penalty, many juries would not convict defendants if the offences were not serious. This led to reforms of Britain's death penalty. From 1823-1837, the death penalty was eliminated for over 100 of 222 crimes punishable by death.
