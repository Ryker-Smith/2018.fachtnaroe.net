<H2>Early and Mid-Twentieth Century</H2>
<P>Although some states abolished the death penalty in the mid-19th century, it was really the first half of the 20th century that marked the beginning of the "Progressive Period" of reform in the United States.<P> From 1907 â€“ 1917, six states completely outlawed the death penalty and three states limited it to the rarely committed crimes of treason and first degree murder of a law enforcement officer. This reform was short-lived. There was a frenzied atmosphere in the US, as people began to panic about the threat of revolution in the wake of the Russian Revolution. As the US had also entered World War 1 and there were intense class conflicts as socialists mounted the first serious challenge to capitalism. As a result, five of the six abolitionist states reinstated the death penalty by 1920.

<P>In 1924, the use of cyanide gas was introduced, as Nevada looked for a more humane way of executing its inmates. Gee Jon was the first person executed by lethal gas. From the 1920s to the 1940s, there was a resurgence in the use of the death penalty. This was due in part to the writings of criminologists, who argued that the death penalty was a necessary social measure. Americans were suffering Prohibition and the Great Depression. There were more executions in the 1930s than any other decade in American history, an average of 167 per year. In the 1950s public sentiment began to turn away from capital punishment. Many allied nations either abolished or limited the death penalty, and in America the  number of executions dropped dramitically.</P>
