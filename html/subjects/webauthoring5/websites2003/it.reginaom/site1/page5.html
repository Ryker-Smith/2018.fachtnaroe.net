<H2>States with the Death Penalty Vs States without the Death Penalty</H2>
<P>A new survey by the New York Times found that states without the death penalty have lower homicide rates than states with the death penalty. The Times reported that ten of the twelve states without the death penalty have homicide rates below the national average, whereas half the states with the death penalty have homicide rates abive. During the last 20 y
ears, the homicide rate in states with the death penalty has been 48%-101% higher than in states without the death penalty.</P>

<P>When comparisons are made between states with the death penalty and states without, the majority of death penalty states show murder rates higher than non-death penalty states. The average of murder rates per 100,000 population in 1999 amoung death penalty states was 5.5, whereas the average of murder rates among non-death penalty states was only 3.6. </P>
