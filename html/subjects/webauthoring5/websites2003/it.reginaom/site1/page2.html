<H2>The Nineteenth Century</H2>

<P>In 1846, Michigan became the firststate to abolish the death penalty for all crimes except treason. Later, Rhode Island and Wisconsis abolished the death penalty for all crimes. By the end of the Century, countries such as Venezula, Portugal, Netherlands, Costa Rica, Brazil and Ecuador had all followed suit.

Although some US states began abolishing the death penalty, most states held on to capital punishment.</P>
<P> Some states made more crimes capital offences, especially offences committed by slaves. In 1838, in an effort to make the death penalty more palatable to the public, some states began passing laws against mandatory death sentencing instead of enacting discretionary death penalty statutes.
<P>The 1838 enactment of discretionary death penalty statutes in Tennessee and later in Alabama was seen as a great reform. This introduction of sentencing discretion in the capital states mandated the death penalty for anyone convicted of a capital crime, regardless of circumstances. With the execption of a small number of rarely committed crimes in a few juristictions, 1963 had abolished all mandatory capital punishment laws.

During the Civil War, opposition to the death penalty waned, as more attention was given to the anti-slavery movement. After the war, new developements in the means of executions emerged. The first electric chair was built in New York in 1888. In 1890, William Kemmler became the first person to be executed by the electric chair. Soon, other states adopted this method of execution.</P>
