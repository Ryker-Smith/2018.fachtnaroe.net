<p>Fota Wildlife Park, just ten miles from Cork on the Cobh road, is among the most modern wildlife parks in Europe. It was established in 1983 by the Zoological Society of Ireland with the primary aim of conservation and the breeding of endangered species.<br> <br> Fota has over seventy species of exotic wildlife in open natural surroundings. The animals are not restrained by cages or obvious barriers, yet visitors walk through the park in complete safety. Giraffes, zebras, ostrich and antelope roam together in forty acres of grassland, much as they would on the African savannah; monkeys swing through trees on lake islands, while kangaroos, macaws and lemurs and other species have complete freedom of the Park. Only the cheetahs have a conventional fence.<br> <br> An extensive education programme is available for school and other groups, based on project sheets and information packs. Education officer also offers courses to schools, base<h1><center><table border="0" width="90%"><tbody><tr><td width="15%"><p>Zoological Societies all over the world play a vital roll in conservation through breeding endangered species, with the ultimate aim of returning them to the wild when conditions permit. For these species, and for many species that now seem numerous, wildlife parks such as Fota offer a sanctuary where the threat of extinction can be held at bay.<br> <br> A great many of the species at Fota are under serious threat in the wild. It is estimated that fewer than 10,000 cheetahs now remain in their natural habitat and Fota Wildlife Park is one of the world's leading breeding centres for this endangered species. Also being bred at Fota are Scimitar-horned Oryx, brought to the brink of extinction but being reintroduced in its native North American habitat; and Lion-tailed Macaque, of which onlyd on the Irish curriculum.</p>
