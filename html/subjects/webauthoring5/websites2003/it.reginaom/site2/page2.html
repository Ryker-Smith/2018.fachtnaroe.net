<H2>Malignant Melanoma</H2>
<P>Malignant melanomas usually begin either on a pigmented patch, or on a flat patch like an unusual freckle. Melanoma also commonly occurs on a new or existing blackish-brown mole. Melanomas can grow and spread at varying rates. In men the most common site is on the ear and on the trunk, whereas in women the most common site is on the legs.
Fair Irish skin burns easily so it is important to protect both adult’s and children’s skin
Malignant melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, but is not as common as other forms of skin cancer
As skin cancer can be seen on the skin surface it can be diagnosed early and cured. If malignant melanoma is diagnosed early the outcome is excellent.</P>
