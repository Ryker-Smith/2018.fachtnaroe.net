<H2> What is skin cancer?</H2>

<P>In order to better understand cancer of the skin, it is useful to have some background information.
The skin is the largest organ in the body. It protects the body from injury, infection sunlight, cold, heat, wet and environmental hazards such as bacteria, viruses and chemicals. It also helps to regulate body temperature and it excretes waste substances.
The skin is divided into two main layers: the epidermis, which is the layer nearest to the surface and the dermis, which is the layer underneath. Most of the cells, which make up the surface of the epidermis, are called squamous cells.
By contrast basal cells are found in the deeper layers of the epidermis. Between the basal cells is another skin cell type called melanocytes. These melanocytes produce the pigment melanin which gives skin its colour variations and allows the skin to tan.</P>

<H2>Types of skin cancer</H2>
<P>Skin cancer can arise in any of the three types of cells mentioned, namely; squamous cell carcinoma in the squamous cells, basal cell carcinoma in the basal cells, and malignant melanoma in the melanocytes.</P>
