<H2>Facts about Skin Cancer </H2>
<P>Almost 39% of all Cancer diagnosed in Ireland during 1997 was skin cancer!`
The main cause of skin cancer is repeated sunburn and over-exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun.
Pale or fair-skinned, fair or red-haired, and blue-eyed people are at highest risk of over exposure.
Skin cancer is broadly grouped into two types, cancer of the melanocytes (termed melanoma) and cancer of either the squamous or basal cells of the skin (termed non-melanoma).</P>


<H2>Non-melanoma skin cancer </H2>
<P>Of the non-melanoma skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma (rodent cell ulcer) is the most common. This type of skin cancer arises from the cells in the base of the skin and develops on areas of the body exposed to sunlight, for example on the face and trunk. It grows slowly and rarely affects other parts of the body.
Squamous cell carcinoma is the next most common type of skin cancer, which also develops on areas exposed to sunlight, like the head and hands. It often begins as a pre-cancerous lesion called a solar or senile keratosis and it can spread to regional lymph nodes.
Most skin cancers occur on the face in both men and women 
Skin cancer on the leg in woman is the next most common site of non-melanoma skin cancer. 
Basal cell carcinoma does not spread, but it can erode the skin and cause an ulcer. Squamous cell carcinoma may spread if left untreated. 
More than 90% of patients with basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are completely cured.</P>
