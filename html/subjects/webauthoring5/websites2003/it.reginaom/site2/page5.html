<H2>Screening for Skin Cancer</H2> </P>
<P>There is no screening programme for skin cancer. However, as skin cancers are readily visible, it is advisable to be aware of your body and take note of your skin and any changes. This is termed self-screening. Certain changes occur to the skin as we age, and these need to be distinguished from more serious changes. If you are uncertain about a change in a mole, or the appearance of a skin marking or ulcer, see your general practitioner as soon as possible, as they will be able to advise and educate you about your skin</P>

<H2>How is it diagnosed? </H2>
</CENTER>
<P>Both non-melanoma skin cancer and malignant melanoma are diagnosed by biopsy. The doctor will remove part of or in some cases the entire lesion and send it to the laboratory to check whether it is cancer. 
If malignant melanoma is diagnosed, then further tests may need to be conducted, these include:
<UL>
<LI>A series of blood tests
<LI>A Chest X-ray
<LI>Liver and abdomen ultrasound
<LI>An isotope bone scan
<LI>A CT scan
<LI>A MRI scan
</UL>

<H2>What is the treatment? </H2>
</CENTER>
<P>Surgical removal is the most common treatment for skin cancers (88%)
If they are not treated promptly, they will do considerable damage to the tissue around them and even spread.
<P><B>Depending on the size and stage of the cancer treatment options include:</B></P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Surgical removal, in some cases a skin graft may be needed following surgery.
<LI>Electrosurgery/cauterisation for small tumours.
<LI>Cryosurgery, which involves freezing pre-malignant and very small cancers with liquid nitrogen.
<LI>Radiotherapy either in addition to surgery
<LI>Chemotherapy applied directly to the skin.
<LI>Alpha Interferon, which is normally produced by the body to fight viral infections, is sometimes given to reduce the risk of melanoma recurring. It can also be used to treat melanoma which has recurred or which has spread to other parts of the body.</UL>
If untreated, malignant melanoma spreads to other parts of the body especially the liver, lungs, bones and brain and is then fatal.</P>
