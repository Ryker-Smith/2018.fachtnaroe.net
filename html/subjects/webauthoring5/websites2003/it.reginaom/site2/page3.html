<H2>How to Reduce the Risk of Developing Skin Cancer </H2>
<P>The most effective sunscreen is clothing, so cover up in the sun.
Hats and baseball caps protect your head from the sun. 
Wear a T-shirt or top in the midday sun. 
Protect your eyes from the sun by wearing sunglasses 
Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) 15 or higher with UVA and UVB protection and re-apply every two hours on your face and on all exposed skin. 
Between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. is the most dangerous time for sunlight. 
Take special care to protect children. 
The Irish Cancer Society recommends that you avoid the use of sunbeds and sunlamps</P>
