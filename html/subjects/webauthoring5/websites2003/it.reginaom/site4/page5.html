<font COLOR="333366"><P>St. Finn Barre's Cathedral now stands where St. Finbarr, Cork's patron saint, founded a monastery in the 7th century. The original monastery grew wealthy over the years and attracted the attentions of Viking pirates, who raided the monastery and city but returned in later years to settle and trade. The triple-spire cathedral itself is an excellent example of French-Gothic architecture and some of its striking features include the fine rose window, the mosaic pavements and elaborate carvings. Just over North Gate Bridge, Shandon Church, the red and white towering steeple of which you will certainly have already noticed, is worth a visit. Its peal of bells has become famous over the years, while visitors may actually try their hand at playing the bells from music cards provided.</P>
