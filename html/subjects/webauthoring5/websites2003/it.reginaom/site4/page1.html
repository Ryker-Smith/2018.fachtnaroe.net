<P><font COLOR="333366">There are a number of places worth visiting while in Cork. Start with the imposing St. Finbarr's Cathedral which was built by the renowned Victorian architect William Burges. Across the river is St Anne's Church, Shandon. This church houses the Shandon Bells and the tower has two sides faced with limestone and two faced with sandstone. Cork City Goal has a fascinating 35-minute taped tour and also houses the National Radio Museum where you learn about Marconi's conquest of the airwaves.</P>
<P> If you are interested in exploring the shops of Cork, you will also get a sense of the traditions of the city. Patrick Street and Grand Parade make up the commercial heart of Cork. Modern chain stores stand alongside the more modest businesses which have lined these streets for decades. Be warned though that parking is increasingly difficult to find in the centre of the city, especially on Saturdays and so you may be advised to make use of the efficient public transport system. One hundred yards from Patrick Street you will find the Coal Quay Market. This is an ideal place where you will be able to peruse local crafts and organic produce. If you are curious about the history of trade in the city, a visit to the Cork Public Museum in Fitzgerald Park is a must. Charting the history of Republicanism primarily, the museum has side exhibits on trade and the guilds in Cork as well as information on silver and glassware in the area. </P>

<P>Cork's cultural rivalry with Dublin extends to stout. Murphys and Beamish are two local stouts that are brewed here. Murphys is not as bitter as Guinness and Beamish has stronger 'roast' flavour.</P>
<P>Cork City is full of pubs and traditional music can be heard in a number of them. While in the centre of Cork, you should maybe try An Spailpín Fánach in South Main Street or An Bodhrán in Oliver Plunkett Street. The Long Valley in Winthrop Street is viewed as simply "a Cork institution". Cork is also well supplied with fine restaurants and interesting cafes and bistros.</font></P>
