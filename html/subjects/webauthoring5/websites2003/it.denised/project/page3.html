<P>Willliam Burges was appointed architect for a new cathedral in 1862, after a competition for which there were 63 entries.

<P>In the end some £100,000 was spent on the building.
In 1865 the foundation stone was laid by Bishop John Gregg and on St. Andrew's Day,1870, the building was consecrated.</P>
