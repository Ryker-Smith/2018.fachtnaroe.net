</CENTER>


<P>Two new Irish Red Cross delegates will be travelling to work with the International Committee of the Red Crescent, (ICRC) in Israel and Jordan a few days. John Rowland from Inchicore, Dublin and Patrick McManus from Tipperary will be working as part of the ICRC humanitarian aid programme in Israel and Jordan.</P>

<P>Patrick McManus will work as a driver delivering food supplies in Israel. He previously worked for the ICRC driving in Croatia and Bosnia in 1994 and as a conveyer from Brussels to Tajikistan in 1996 and more recently in Dili, East Timor as a conveyor and warehouse manager.</P>

<P>"I am familiar with most driving conditions in European countries and look forward to this new challenge in Israel. I find this type of work very rewarding. When you are making a delivery of 24 tonnes of food or medical supplies you really feel you are making a difference," he said.</P>

<P>For John Rowland, working in overseas aid is a new experience. John will work in logistics and relief supplies in Jordan. He has a wealth of experience from his previous position as a production manager in a manufacturing firm where he was responsible for 40 staff, organising daily shipments of goods and production schedules.</P>

<P>Ms. Carmel Dunne, Secretary General of the Irish Red Cross said she is proud to announce two new Irish delegates who will add to the strong presence of Irish personnel overseas.</P>

<P>"Irish volunteers have a proven track record of this work throughout the world. All of us in Ireland should be very proud of their contribution. Having a volunteer working overseas also plays an important part in our fundraising efforts. There are many examples of relatives and friends of volunteers becoming actively involved in fundraising efforts," Carmel said.</P>

<P>The Irish Red Cross Society has been placing personnel overseas on a regular basis since 1985. Numbers placed per year vary from 30 - 50.</P>

<P>Skilled and professional personnel are assigned to Overseas Operations in response to requests from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC).</P>

<P>Disaster, Rehabilitation, and Development Operations throughout the world deal either with War Relief or Natural Disaster Relief. These Operations provide medical and nursing care to the wounded and sick as well as organising accommodation for Refugees and Internally Displace People and supplies of food and clean water.</P>

<P>Longer-term objectives include the development of National Societies locally so that they can organise their own Disaster Preparedness Plans to reduce casualties and provide more immediate care to the sick, injured and homeless.</P>
