<P>The Irish Red Cross Society is actively involved in the provision of First Aid and Health & Safety Education, having been to the forefront in these areas since its inception.
Initiatives in domestic healthcare over the course of the Society's history include the establishment of TB sanitoria, the Blood Transfusion Service, and water safety awareness campaigns prior to the establishment of the Water Safety Council.</P>

<P>Since then the Irish Red Cross has developed its expertise in a range of First Aid and Resuscitation services. Based on this expertise, the Irish Red Cross offers First-Aid cover at events and First-Aid Training to employers, groups and individuals. People who join the Irish Red Cross can train to become members of a local uniformed First Aid Unit and then provide cover at local events.</P>
