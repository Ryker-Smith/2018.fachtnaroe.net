<P>The Irish Red Cross Society is dedicated to the provision of Emergency and Humanitarian Relief both at home and abroad through its network of volunteers both nationally and internationally.</P>

<P>Within Ireland, the Red Cross provides both emergency services through its Mountain Rescue Team as well as a variety of broadly-based community services including youthwork and care for the sick and elderly. Moreover, the Red Cross has secured both national and European recognition for its high-quality courses in First-Aid for individuals, groups and employers, which is based on its own extensive experience in the provision of First-Aid at both national and local events.</P>
