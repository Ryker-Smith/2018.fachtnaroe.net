<H1>Cahir House Hotel</H1>
<P> It's history is an inextricable part of Tipperary's history. Generations have used the hotel as the resting point on their journey since the time of the Bianconi horse drawn coaches.
Cahir House replaced Cahir Castle in the 1770's as the ancestral home of the Butlers of Cahir, whose titles include Barons of Cahir and Earls of Glengall. Cahir House was 'home' to Lord Cahir's family until 1961 when Richard Butler Charteris died, thus ending a 600 year association between the Butlers and Cahir. In 1927 Miss Nora Burke leased the premises and opened Cahir House Hotel.
Over the years the hotel has paid host to such illuminaries as De Valera, W.T. Cosgrave, Mae West, Douglas Fairbanks, Walt Disney, Jackie Kennedy etc. A long tradition of warm Irish Hospitality awaits the visitor to Cahir House Hotel.

<P>Set like a jewel in the centre of the heritage town of Cahir, Cahir House Hotel offers the visitor an opportunity to enjoy modern comforts with old world charm and elegance.
