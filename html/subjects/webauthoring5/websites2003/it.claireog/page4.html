<P>Built in 1833 by Fr. Michael Tobin. 50 years later it has to be repaired by Rev. Maurice Mooney, P.P. an older Church than the present one had been erected on the spot in 1791. Prior to this parishioners worshipped in a thatched chapel which stood near the entrance gate to Cahir Park. This Chapel was a chapel of the Penal Days, but the Butlers of that period were Catholics, therefore they provided the people of Cahir with a place of worship In 1895, Lady Charteris leased 3/4 acre of land to the Church. Rev. William O'Donnell who was here between 1924 and 1933 got a further extension. He also purchased the present Parochial House. Rev. William Burke, the Curate in 1904, erected the Curate's House.
