<P> This example was built in 1810 for the young society couple, Richard Butler, Lord Cahir, and his wife Emily. They succeeded in attracting the well-known English architect, John Nash, to come to Ireland to design the building, which he followed two years later with the King's Cottage in Windsor Park. The Swiss Cottage, which got its sobriquet decades after it was built because of its resemblance to some Alpine homes, is a two-storey house which was given a new, superbly executed roof of thatch in 1989-90, and provided at the same time with stick-work verandahs on the outside. Inside, the furniture and wall-paper, part original and part-restoration, have been assembled with great flair and taste, with advice from the haut couturiere Sybil Connolly and with maximum support from its American former owner, Sally Aall.

<P>About a mile south of the town, and built on a platform with a fine view over the River Suir, is the Swiss Cottage. This is one of the earliest and best of those insular cottages ornees - the kind of fantasy house invented by Marie Antoinette so that she could play at living an idyllic rural life in full view of her palace at the centre of Paris.
