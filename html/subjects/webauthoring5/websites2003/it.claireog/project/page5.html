It's the year 1879.  I'm a warder.  My name is John O'Callaghan.  I work in the Old Women's Gaol.  It's dirty, smelly, and disease-bound.  I get up and give the prisoners their food.  I give them Indian food called maize.  It tastes awful.  It's all the maggots deserve.

Today there is one young boy who is th be flogged.  His name is William O'Donavan.  He robbed brass.  It's my turn to use the whip.  Hw's only seven but he still deserves it.  He needs to be taught a lesson.  I went in and gave him his whips.  Whip after whip.  I come to another inmate.  Her name is Jill O'Donovan.  She gives me the brass she stole.  In return I give her some of the we are given ourselves.  The conditions are terrible.

They get up early and start cleaning their cells. Then they go outside to exercise. They have to keep five paces apart. They then begin their ahrd days work. They get very little time to rest. The caulking is the worst work their knuckles bleed. Sometimes we have hangings. All the prisoners have to watch them die. After they string them up the plank breaks and they die a slow death.
<P>
Life isn’t easy for me either. I have to sleep on the same beds as the prisoners. I’m not allowed to talk to the other guards. I have to keep to myself, no one talks except at night when we’re playing cards. We’re lucky with our fire though.This helps to keep us warm and we can cook things on the fire.
<P>
We sometimes help the prisoners by leaving doors open and by putting ladders up so that they can escape. We get well paid if we do. We could end up locked away for a long time if we are caught. Life as a warder is not what I expected. In this time of poverty at least I have food and a roof over my head.
