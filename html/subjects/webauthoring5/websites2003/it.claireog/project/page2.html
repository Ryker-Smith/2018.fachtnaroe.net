Cork City Gaol is located in an area called Sundays Well. The Gaol was constructed in 1824. In the beginning it served as a prison for both males and females of all ages. Later it became the city's women's prison. During the nineteenth century conditions within the prison were wretched. Prisoners slept on straw, were fed with a meagre ration of bread and gruel and whipped for breaking prison rules. Most prisoners ended up in the City Gaol for offences which we would now not consider serious. In most cases their major crime was rampant in the city during the nineteenth century. The cell became home to young boys caught stealing and mothers nursing babies as well as the committed criminals. There are also stories of the city's poor committing crimes in order to be put in the prison, where at least they would be fed. In 1922 the gaol was used to house republican prisoners during the Civil War. These were the last people imprisoned here. Cork Gaol closed soon after.
