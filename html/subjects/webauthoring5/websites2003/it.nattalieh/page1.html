<p>Cork City is the third largest city in Ireland (second largest city in the south of Ireland) and has always been an important seaport. It began on an island in the swampy estuary of the River Lee (the Irish for Cork 'Corcaigh' means a marsh) and gradually climbed up the steep banks on either side. Today the river flows through the city in two main channels so you find yourself constantly crossing bridges.The city is often called "Rebel Cork" because it was a center of the 19th century Fenian movement and played an active part in the Irish struggle for independence.
Cork people have a great passion for sport, particularly hurling, and this is typified in the naming of a bridge after one of it?s greatest hurlers, namely, Christy Ring Bridge.Cork is a place of commercial importance, largely due to the excellence of its harbour. It is an export centre for the agricultural produce of the south, and the many industries in the city include brewing, distilling, hosiery, flour milling, bacon curing, chemical and paint works, clothing and footwear factories.<p>
