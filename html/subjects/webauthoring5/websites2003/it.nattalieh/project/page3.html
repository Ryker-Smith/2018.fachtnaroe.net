<H3 ALIGN ="CENTER">Historical Background</H3>

<p>University College Cork (UCC) is one of four constituent universities of the federal National University of Ireland.

 

Founded in 1845, UCC is one of Ireland’s oldest institutes of higher learning  and was originally established as Queen’s College. At the same time two other Queen’s Colleges were established in southern and northern Ireland-one in Galway, the other in Belfast.

 

The original site chosen for the University is believed to have a connection with the patron saint of Cork, St Finbarr who set up a monastery and school of learning in close proximity to the University. Hence the University’s motto “Where Finbarr Taught, Let Munster Learn.”<p>
