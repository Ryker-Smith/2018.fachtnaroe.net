    <H1>Dowd's Lane</H1>

    <P>
     In 1935 William Magner founded a cider making company in Dowds Lane. In 1937 he amalgamated his business with H.P. Bulmer and Co., but the partnership was dissolved nine years later. Since 1946, the world famous cider bearing the Bulmers label has been produced in Clonmel. Its unique flavour can be attributed to the traditional natural processes, which are still used in its production. The fertile land of the Clonmel area produces most of the apples required for the cider industry today.

    <H1> Jail Gate </H1>
    <P>Formerly Clonmel had the following jails:

     O Connell Street - close to the West Gate
     Gladstone Street - opposite Sts. Peter and Pauls Church
     Emmet Street - Jail and Borstal

     The Jail in Gladstone Street was built in the late 1700s and had 6 dungeons. Fr. Nicholas Sheehy was imprisoned there while awaiting trial in 1766. After his execution his head was displayed on the gates of the jail as a warning to others. The jail at Emmet Street was built at the end of the 18th century. It comprised 42 large single cells, 198 smaller cells, 12 solitary cells, 13 day rooms, 16 work rooms and 24 yards.</P>
