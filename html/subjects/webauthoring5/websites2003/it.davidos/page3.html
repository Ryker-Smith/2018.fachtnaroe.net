 <H1>Town Walls</H1>
 <P> The town walls were built in the 14th Century under Otho de Grandison, the High Sheriff and first Lord of the Mayor of Clonmel. The walls enclosed a square roughly 320m N-S by 412m E-W, bounded on the south by the River Suir. The first murage grant or wall building grant was sanctioned in 1298 and more followed in 1316, 1335 and 1364. These walls were built at great cost to the local people. The walls proved valuable in 1650, when Oliver Cromwell and his parliamentarian forces besieged the town. Cromwell had already taken Cahir, Cashel and Fethard inside a week but he met his stiffest opposition in Clonmel where he suffered the loss of about two thousand men.
