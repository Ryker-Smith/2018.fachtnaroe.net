  <P>The prison had an average of 340 prisoners at any one time. Prisoners sentenced to death were hanged in front of the jail in the yard or at Gallows Hill to the north of the town. Just outside the prison gates there was a pillory, a frame with holes for the unfortunate wrongdoer's head and hands. Those convicted of minor offences were locked into the pillory, where they were pelted with missiles by the townspeople. The new jail in Emmet Street was later used as the only Borstal Institution in Ireland.
