<P>The following are some of the measures that The Health Promotion Unit, The Dept. of Health & Children is involved in to help tackle alcohol related problems.

<LI>Since the launch of the National Alcohol Policy in 1996, The Health Promotion Unit, The Dept. of Health & Children, The Dept. of Health & Children has been in discussion with relevant statutory bodies and with the Drinks Industry Group in relation to appropriate responses to the Policy. The Unit, in conjunction with the Drinks Industry Group has developed a Responsible Server Training programme for those who serve alcohol. Issues such as drunkenness, drink-driving and underage drinking are covered on this programme.

<LI>Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be better equipped to make more informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol. Work is also ongoing on the development of the school curriculum, based on a lifeskills approach, that includes an alcohol awareness module.

<LI>Training is available for professionals and parents at community level through the regional health boards, with the purpose of helping long term prevention of alcohol and drug misuse.

<LI>Research on the impact of alcohol advertising on young people has been carried out on behalf of the Unit. The results of this research will help to inform further action in this area.

The Health Promotion Unit, The Dept. of Health & Children, The Dept. of Health & Children made a number of recommendations, relating to the advertising of alcohol, to the Authority and many of these are have been adopted.

<LI>The Less is More - It's Your Choice alcohol awareness campaign, specifically targeting young high-risk drinkers, was launched in February 2001. This three year campaign is expanding to include other high risk groups.

<LI>A document entitled "Framework for Developing a College Alcohol Policy" has been produced by the third level institutes/universities in association with The Health Promotion Unit, The Dept. of Health & Children. This will allow third level institutions to develop individual Campus Alcohol Policies. Some of the aims of this document include promoting the health and well being of students and staff, providing an atmosphere free from pressure to drink and enhancing a positive campus environment where low risk drinking is the 'social norm'.
