<P>Alcoholism, which is also known as "alcohol dependence" is a disease that is characterized by the following elements:
<UL>
<LI><B>Craving:</B> a strong need, or compulsion, to drink.
<LI><B>Loss of control:</B> the frequent inability to stop drinking once a person has begun.
<LI><B>Physical dependence:</B> the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, sweating, shakiness, and anxiety, when alcohol use is stopped after a period of heavy drinking. These symptoms are usually relieved by drinking alcohol or by taking another sedative drug.
<LI><B>Tolerance:</B> the need for increasing amounts of alcohol in order to get "high".
</UL>
<P>Alcoholism has little to do with what kind of alcohol one drinks, how long one has been drinking, or even exactly how much alcohol one consumes. But it has a great deal to do with a person's uncontrollable need for alcohol. This description of alcoholism helps us understand why most alcoholics can't just "use a little willpower" to stop drinking. He or she is frequently in the grip of a powerful craving for alcohol, a need that can feel as strong as the need for food or water. While some people are able to recover without help, the majority of alcoholic individuals need outside assistance to recover from their disease.

<P>With support and treatment, many individuals are able to stop drinking and rebuild their lives. Many people wonder: "Why can some individuals use alcohol without problems, while others are utterly unable to control their drinking?" Recent research has demonstrated that for many people, a vulnerability to alcoholism is inherited. Yet it is important to recognize that aspects of a person's environment, such as peer influences and the availability of alcohol, are also significant influences. Both inherited and environmental influences are called "risk factors." But risk is not destiny. Just because alcoholism tends to run in families doesn't mean that a child of an alcoholic parent will automatically develop alcoholism.
<P><H2>What are the signs of a problem?</H2>

<P>Dependence on alcohol has two components, psychological dependence and physical dependence. When psychologically dependant the person feels a need for drink, but would not develop withdrawal symptoms if they were to stop. When physically dependant, a person develops a craving for drink and experiences unpleasant physical syomtoms if he or she does not drink. In such cases, it would be irresponsible and dangerous for the person to stop drinking suddenly, without professional medical support and guidance.

<P><B>Early Warning Signs</B>
How can you tell whether you, or someone close to you, may have a drinking problem? Answering the following four questions can help you find out. (To help remember these questions, note that the first letter of a key word in each of the four questions spells "CAGE.")
<UL>
<LI>Have you ever felt you should <B>Cut</B> down on your drinking?
<LI>Have people <B>Annoyed</B> you by criticising your drinking?
<LI>Have you ever felt bad or <B>Guilty</B> about your drinking?
<LI>Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover <B>(Eye opener)?</B>
</UL>
<P>One "yes" response suggests a possible alcohol problem. If you responded "yes" to more than one question, it is highly likely that a problem exists. In either case, it is important that you see your doctor and discuss your responses to these questions. He or she can help you determine whether you have a drinking problem and, if so, recommend the best course of action for you.

<P>Even if you answered "no" to all of the above questions, if you are encountering alcohol-related problems with your job, relationships, health, or with the law, you should still seek professional help. The effects of alcohol abuse can be extremely serious, even fatal, both to you and to others.
