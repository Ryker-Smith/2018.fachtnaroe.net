<P><H3>Background:</H3>
<P>The Cork City Gaol in Sunday's Well, was designed to replace the old Gaol at the Northgate Bridge in the heart of the city. The old gaol was nearly 100 yrs. old, on a confined site, overcrowded & unhygienic.
<IMG SRC="images/corkcitygaol.jpg" ALIGN="Right" width="265" height="176">In 1806 an Act of Parliament was passed and monies levied locally to allow the building of a new City Gaol. The first site chosen was at Distillery Fields - an area prone to frequent flooding!! This fact, and enlightened thinking that hilly, airy sites were best for containing gaol fever probably influenced the change to the present site.<P>

<P>In 1816 red sandstone was quarried from the hill, approach roads constructed, and outside security walls built. By 1818 planning of the interior building could commence and Mrs. Deane, and her son, Thomas, won the building contract. John Hogan, later to become Ireland's greatest neo-classical sculptor, developed sketch drawings from the plans of architect, William Robertson of Kilkenny.
