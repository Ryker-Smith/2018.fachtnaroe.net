<LI>Ireland's consumption continued to increase in 2000 and ranked 2nd after Luxembourg for alcohol consumption with a rate of 11 litres of pure alcohol per head of population. The EU average for 2000 was 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita.

<LI>While beer continues to dominate the alcohol market, although at a reduced share, the sales of wine and cider have seen substantial growth.

<LI>In 1996 there was a 10% increase in spirit sales in Ireland and similar increased growth has continued to the present.

<LI>The increase in spirits consumption is partly due to the new 'designer drinks' which are targeted at the young adult market and the popular party chasers such as 'vodka and red bull'.
<LI>Cider showed the most consistent growth rate over the last decade and had a market share of about 9% in 2000.
