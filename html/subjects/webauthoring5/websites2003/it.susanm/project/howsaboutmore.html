<H2>CLUBBING IN CORK!!</H2>
<P>Mangans was designed by one of Europe's top layout design artists. At Mangans we are all very conscious that patrons can circulate from level to level.

Mangans boasts three levels which are serviced by their own bars so patrons can get a different perspective from each of the different bars/levels. Mangans is known locally as the 'House of Mirrors' (so seeing is believing) so lets see your face in the place Tuesday to Sunday!!!

We have installed a superb digital surround system which emphasises quality rather than volume once again hearing is believing.
