There are 2,200 street parking spaces controlled by a disk parking system.   <P>Disks are valid for parking for periods of 1,2 or 4 hours per disk depending on the parking zone used.   The time allowed is displayed on the information plate adjacent to the parking space. Disks are sold in convenience stores and cost €1.15 each or €11.50 per book of 10.   Holes are punched representing the time parking commenced and the disk is displayed from inside the car on the kerb side.  There are 8 multi-story above ground cark parks serving the city centre area.   Parking charges range from €1.00 - €1.50 per hour.  While the Grand Parade car park has overnight rates,  it is closed to access between 00.00 and 08.00 and all day Sunday.

<H2>Irish Money</H2>

<P>The currency in the Republic of Ireland is the Euro (ISO currency code EUR).  There are 7 euro notes. In different colours and sizes they are denominated in 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10 and 5 euros. The notes are uniform throughout the euro area; unlike coins, they have no national side. The designs are symbolic for Europe's architectural heritage. They do not represent any existing monuments.

There are 8 euro coins denominated in 2 and 1 euros, then 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 cents. Every euro coin carries a common European face. On the reverse, each Member State has their own motif.  In the case of Irish coins they have a harp, the date and the word "éire" - i.e. word for Ireland in the Irish language.

The Euro is worth just under a US dollar at the time of writing.  The exact up to the minute exchange rate to your home currency can be found here.

<P>You can use Euro notes and coins (irrespective of design) in any Euro participating country.   This includes Andorra, Austria,  Belgium, Finland, France (including overseas departments and territories), Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Portugal, San Marino, Spain,   and Vatican City.

<P>If the single character Euro symbol € doesn't display or print properly on your system (it should look somewhat like "C" with "=" through the middle), you can download the Euro symbol software update from Microsoft Euro   Linux (Debian). If you use another operating system, visit the relevant operating system developer's website for system updating information.

Old Irish banknotes can be converted into Euro at any Irish bank or at many banks around the world.


Northern Ireland

The currency of Northern Ireland is the pound Sterling (currency code GBP).


Sterling banknotes are issued in GBP 5, GBP 10, GBP 20 and GBP 50 denominations


Coins are issued in the following denominations: 100p, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p and 1p.

It is important to have a supply of the correct local currency for the jurisdiction you are visiting. ATMs which accept any Visa, Plus, Cirrus, MasterCard, Eurocard, or Eurocheque card are available 24 hours/day at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports. These dispense Euro, Sterling and other currencies. Click on the airport of your choice for information on airport banking hours and other airport related information. Your own currency can be changed into Euro or Sterling at the airport bank when you arrive. Rates will usually be better than if one bought Irish currency outside the country. In addition to banks, money can be changed at most Post Offices, Tourist Offices, and hotels.
