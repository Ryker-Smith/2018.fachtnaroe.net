<P>Nutrition and hair</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="TERMINAL">A healthy diet is essential for a healthy growth system in the body. Proteins, vitamins, minerals and water provide the hair's more essential components. That is not to say that fats, carbohydrates and other nutritional items are not significant, but their presence is not critical. If you consider the large number of vitamins, amino acids and minerals necessary for healthy growth of hair and skin, you can begin to appreciate the complexity of the body's task in keeping itself healthy.

Although proteins account for an amazing 97% of the structure of the hair, only 15-20% of the nutritional intake of proteins provides for the replacement of the hair and skin. The hair's physical condition (i.e. colour and texture) can change during protein and calorie malnutrition.

<P>Most vitamins and minerals are concerned with the structure, pigmentation and keratinisation of the hair. All falsoluble vitamins play an active part in providing the nutritional materials for healthy growing hair. Vitamin A-excess or deficiency can result in abnormal keratinisation of epithelium cells. Excess of Vitamin A or D will result in hair loss.

Vitamin B: Job related B-Vitamins provide the body with energy by converting carbohydrates into glucose, which the body 'burns' to produce energy. The B-Vitamins are vital in the metabolism of fats and proteins. They may also be the single most important factor for health and nerves. Lack of B-Vitamins can lead to graying hair, baldness, acne and other skin related problems.

B-Deficiency can cause (Vitamin B2): hair loss, scabbiness of the skin and other B-Deficiencies such as poor appetite, insomnia, neuritis, anemia, constipation or high cholesterol.

The graying of hair (B5 Hyper pigmentation and epidermal changes - lack of B12) All B-Vitamins are natural constituents of brewer's yeast (the richest source of the B-complex group), liver, whole grain cereals.

Sleeping pills, insecticides and estrogen create a condition in the digestive tract which can destroy the B-Vitamins. Certain B-Vitamins are lost through perspiration.

<P>Mineral content is between 1% and 2% and fluctuates according to sex, diet, time of the year and environment factors. The content of zinc found in the soil, plants and food affects the body's metabolism of zinc.

Selenium, a trace element found in the hair, has numerous uses, including the control of dandruff. Sources of this helpful element are found in seafoods, meats, milk products, cereals and whole grains (especially wheat).
