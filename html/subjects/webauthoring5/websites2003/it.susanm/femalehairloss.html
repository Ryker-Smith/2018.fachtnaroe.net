<H2>Female hair Loss</H2>
<FONT FACE =Terminal>
<P>Women produce male hormones from the adrenal glands. As many women have a similar baldness pattern to men, they are said to have Androgen dependant Alopecia.   Virilization can result in facial hairs, recession of the scalp hair and thinning on the top area of the scalp. This condition can also be caused by ovarian tumours. An excessive amount of androgens are produced giving rise to a masculinising  effect. This can easily be corrected by medical treatment.

<P>It is only when the scalp shows through on the top of the head, that  we really start to become concerned, usually at menopause. The hair loss has actually taken place over a long period, and the hair suddenly becomes more unmanageable.  This can be avoided if the situation is arrested when the problem starts .The condition is easily reversed with the use of Hair Fantastiques Wonder Hair Treatment Program.

<P>Hair loss in females can begin as early as puberty. Although these changes are hormone dependant they should not be confused with development of pattern baldness. Hormonal  imbalances can be the cause of noticeable thinning  in teenagers. The rapid changes the body is undergoing from child to womanhood can play havoc with the hormonal system and in turn affect the hair growth system. If the hair loss were to continue or become excessive or diffuse, hormone levels should be checked. This is a very stressful time in a young girls life.  Hair Fantastique Wonder Hair Intensive Treatment Program is recommended to avoid unnecessary hair loss and stress. Peer pressure and academic demands can lead to very high stress levels during the school and varsity years. Hair loss is common at this stage of a young girls life.
