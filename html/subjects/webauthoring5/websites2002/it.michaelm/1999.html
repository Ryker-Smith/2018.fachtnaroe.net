Cork Constitution regained the AIB All Ireland League trophy at Lansdowne Road on Saturday 1st May 1999 when they 
defeated Garryowen by 14-11 after a tense and exciting final. <BR>
Noel Murphy, as IRFU President, had the unique honour to present the trophy to his clubmate and captain Philip 
Soden, and medals to the victorious team. <BR>
There followed a rendering of the Cork anthem "Beautiful City" before the celebration of a most unexpected but 
heartily welcome win.<BR>

It was against Shannon that the fates of the respective sides would be decided. <BR>
The game was fixed for Temple Hill on Saturday, 17th April.<BR> 
Shannon had to win by some 7 points to leapfrog Constitution who were two league points ahead with slightly 
superior points difference.<BR>
The game was played in a superb spirit and the league champions of the previous four seasons did not relinquish 
their title easily. <BR>
While Constitution led at all times, they had to withstand severe late pressure to win 26-19. <BR>
In the end, the late score by Jim Galvin deprived Constitution of 1st place in the League table, with Garryowen 
taking it on points differential of just two points.<BR>

Constitution were rewarded with a home semi final against surprise team Buccaneers who were in their first season 
in Division 1.<BR>
The game was played before another huge attendance bedecked in their team’s colours.
Buccaneers again were very gallant opponents as in the earlier league game at Temple Hill, but the home side was 
full value for their 32-20 victory.<BR>

And so to Lansdowne Road again, where Constitution were to ultimately show that they were the best team in the 
competition. <BR>
On the day, Constitution just about deserved to win, a point readily conceded afterwards by Garryowen 
coach John Hall. <BR>
Yet it could hardly have been closer. The sides were level at 11 points each at full time. <BR>
Constitution took an early lead with a superb try from Anthony Horgan and led 11-3 at the break with Ronan O’Gara 
and Kilian Keane kicking two penalties each. <BR>
Garryowen clawed their way back to parity via another Keane penalty and a try by Jack Clark.<BR>

The decisive score came in injury time with almost the last kick of the first period of extra time. <BR>
It followed from Ronan O’Gara’s delicate chip and gather over the Garryowen backs which almost led to a try, <BR>
but Referee Dave McHugh awarded Constitution a penalty for offside from the recycle and the ever-reliable O’Gara 
slotted the kick.<BR>
The final score 14-11 to Con.
