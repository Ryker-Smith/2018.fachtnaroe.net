<H2>Welcome to my site on Cork Constitution.</H2>

My site is designed to give the reader information about the Cork Con Rugby Club.<BR>
The different pages are there to give any information that someone interested in the club could need.<BR>
The main audience for my site will be rugby fans. In particular Cork Constitution fans. <BR>
Hopefully my site will have the right kind of subject matter to keep them interested long enough to look at the whole site. <BR>
