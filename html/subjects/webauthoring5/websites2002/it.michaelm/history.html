The Cork Constitution was a well read newspaper of the day in the last decade of the 1800s.<BR> 
It was a news sheet that did not publish on Sundays, thus allowing the staff to be free on Saturday afternoons.<BR> 
It was decided to form a cricket club. But cricket is a summer pursuit and obviously prompted by the enjoyment  
derived from their summer activities, thoughts turned to a winter activity and to rugby football in particular.<BR>
Some of the staff were very proficient in several sports not least one David Kilroy, who was an all-rounder in the 
true sense. 
With the cricket club firmly established, the rugby club came into existence in 1892. <BR> 
It was Kilroy who inspired the hearts of his colleagues. But he was no purveyor of mere words. <BR> 
He stood ready to lead by precept and example and he was to see his club rise from humble beginnings that embraced rugby in a rather crude from played in primitive conditions on an adhoc basis.<BR> 
Kilroy believed he had the men to lift the club from out of that scene into the big time.<BR> 
How correct he was in his assessment of the talent and the men at his disposal. <BR>
