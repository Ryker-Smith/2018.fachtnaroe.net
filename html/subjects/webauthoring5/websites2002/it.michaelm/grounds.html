Cork Constitution's grounds are located in Ballintemple. Con moved from the Maradyke to Temple Hill in 1953.<BR>
The grounds have expanded since to 12 acres. There are three playing pitches, terracing and a stand which holds 300
people.<BR> The players facilities include 7 dressing rooms, showers and gym. For socialising there is the main 
bar, dance hall and presidents room. On February 1st 2002 Constitution took a major step forward with the switching on of the new floodlights in Temple Hill. Let us hope that Friday nights at Temple Hill can become a major part of 
rugby life in Cork.<BR>
Follow this map to see how to get to Temple Hill.
