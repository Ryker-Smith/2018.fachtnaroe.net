Christy Ring was one of the greatest hurlers that ever played the game.<P> 
He was a legend in the eyes of the cork fans for many years. He not alone had fans in cork but all over Ireland.
<P>
Christy Ring first played for Cork in 1939. His 24-year career record earned him a reputation as the greatest hurler of all time. 
<P>
Christy Ring already had three All-Ireland medals when classic solo-run goals in the 1944 Munster final and 1946 All-Ireland final established him as one of the greatest players in the game. 
His display in the 1951 Munster final when he switched to midfield is rated by many as the best ever. 
His heroics in beating three defenders to set up the winning goal in the 1954 Munster final set up a record eighth All-Ireland medal. 
<P>
He was deprived of a ninth by Wexford goalkeeper, Art Foley, who saved his brilliant shot at the end of the 1956 final. 
Other famous scoring feats included three goals in a four minute spell in the 1956 Munster final against Limerick, three goals and five points in the 1957 Railway cup final and three goals and four points in the 1961 Munster semi-final against Waterford. 
The national top scorer in 1959, 1961 and 1962, he was the only player ever to average more than 10 points per match in 1959.
