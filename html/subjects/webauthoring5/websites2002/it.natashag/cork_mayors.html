<DIV ALIGN"Justify">'I would die rather than part with it' said Terence MacSwiney when they tried
to take his chain of office from him after his arrest in the City Hall on 12 August, 1920. At his 
courtmartial, he castigated his judges for their violation of his office as Lord Mayor and Chief Magistrate.
 
<DIV ALIGN="Justify"><P>The murder of Tomás MacCurtain was a similar violation of his honourable office. 
Both Lord Mayors had a remarkably exalted sense of their 'great' city, as they termed it, and therefore of 
its highest position. [tomas mac curtain] Although they sensed their time was pitifully short, they both 
aspired to creating the ideal municipality in Cork and making it a model of reform and social justice. 
Their memory will be cherished as long as municipal government lasts in Cork. Both Lord Mayors put the 
city not alone before self-interest but above party and faction. For them, truly, authority was service. 
Their ultimate sacrifice was as much civic as nationalist.

Society in 1901 and in 1908, with Daniel Corkery, founded the Cork Dramatic Society, for which he

<P>In 1911 Cork County Council appointed him commercial teacher and organiser of classes in the towns
of County Cork. One of the principals in the forming of the Cork Volunteers in December 1913; two 
years later he resigned from the Cork County Committee of Technical Instruction to become a full-time 
organiser for the Volunteers. In 1914 he published a weekly paper, Fianna Fáil, written almost entirely 
by himself. It was suppressed after eleven issues. A series of articles he wrote for Irish Freedom between 
1912 and 1916 was published posthumously as Principles of Freedom (1921). Arrested in January 1916 and 
charged with making a seditious speech at Ballymoe, County Cork, but released in February without being 
brought to trial. 
<P>On Easter Sunday 1916 he obeyed MacNeill's countermanding order and travelled to Tralee with a British 
army permit to persuade the Kerry Volunteers to give up their arms on agreed conditions. Imprisoned for 
short terms in 1916 and 1917; elected to first Dáil as member for West Cork. Active in setting up Dáil

was elected Lord Mayor of Cork.

<P>On 12 August 1920 the British army raided City Hall and arrested him and others. The prisoners 
agreed that they should go on hunger strike. All but the Lord Mayor were released three days later. 
On 16 August he was court-martialled and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. He told the court 
that by taking no food he would put a limit to any term of imprisonment imposed. On 18 August he 
was given into the custody of Brixton Prison in such a state of collapse that the prison doctor 
decided that he would not be able to survive forcible feeding. However, on 21 October, when his 
condition had worsened considerably, attempts were made to force-feed him. His case attracted 
worldwide attention and many efforts were made to persuade the British government to release him. 
He died at Brixton on 24 October, the seventy-fourth day of his fast.
