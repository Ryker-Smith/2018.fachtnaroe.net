<DIV ALIGN="Justify"><P>Cork nationalist politics were exciting and turbulent in the faction-ridden years following the death of Charles 
Stewart Parnell who was MP for the city, 1880 - 91. The most colourful and volatile figure at the turn of the century 
was William O'Brien who was commemorated in a corporation name change in Blackpool - from Great Britain
Street to Great William O'Brien Street! 

<DIV ALIGN="Justify"><P>The radical nationalist tradition in Cork politics found strong expression in the resurgence of Sinn Féin after 1916. 
The dramatic and tragic highlights of this period were the burning of the city centre by crown forces in December 
1920, and before that, the murder of Lord Mayor Tomás MacCurtain in March and the death from hunger strike in the 
following October of his successor Terence MacSwiney. The public demonstration of sympathy at their obsequies was 
not to be seen again until the State funeral in October 1999, as the century drew to a close, of Jack Lynch, statesman 
and sportsman, and favourite Cork son of all time.

<DIV ALIGN="Justify"><P>One notable development in twentieth-century Cork municipal history has been the great prestige of the office of Lord Mayor. 
Because of the city's particular size and intimate atmosphere, the mayoralty would always have a particular role irrespective 
of other circumstances. But this role was raised to a very special relationship in 1920 because of the ultimate sacrifice in 
office of Tomás MacCurtain and Terence MacSwiney.
The title of Lord Mayor, though a royal designation, was cherished, paradoxically, by the two martyred republicans.
