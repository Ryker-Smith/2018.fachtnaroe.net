11 September 1920.  It was designed by Architects Jones anfd Kelly.  
There is a copper-domed clock tower whish displays six limetone Tuscan Pillars and all these
features are particularly impressive at night.
Much of Corks' buildings are made with limestone which is quarried freom near by at Liitle Island.
