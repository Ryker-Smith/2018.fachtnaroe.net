 (after Dublin and Belfast) and has always been an important seaport. It began on an island in the swampy estuary of
 the River Lee (the name Corcaigh means a marsh), and gradually climbed up the steep banks on either side.</P>

 main channels, so that you find yourself constantly crossing bridges. Some of the main streets are built over channels where 
 ships nuzzled their anchor-chains a century ago. Along the South Mall you will see large gateways at street level, under steps 
 leading to a higher main door. These were once boathouses, when merchants arrived at their warehouses by water.</P>

 He founded a monastery in the seventh century where St. Finn Barre's Cathedral now stands, and it grew into an extensive and wealthy establishment.
 It attracted the attention of the Viking sea-pirates who raided and burned the infant city, but returned in later years to settle and trade. The Anglo-Norman
 invasion in 1172 resulted in both the Danish lords and local McCarthy chiefs having to submit to Henry II, but Cork has always had a reputation for independence
 and stubborn resistance: it came to be known as "Rebel Cork".</P>
