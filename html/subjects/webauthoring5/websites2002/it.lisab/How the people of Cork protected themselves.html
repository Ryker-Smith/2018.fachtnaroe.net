 capital of the South, but considered by Cork people to be the real Capital of Ireland. It is Ireland's third largest city.
 Tradition holds that the city was founded in the late 6th or early 7th century by St. Finbarr, who went there to kill the 
 last dragon in Ireland and who built a monastery on the current south side of the city.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The city is often called "Rebel Cork" because it was a centre of the 19th century
 Fenian movement and played an active part in the Irish struggle for independence.
 Cork people have a great passion for sport, particularly hurling, and this is typified 
 in the naming of a bridge after one of it's greatest hurlers, namely, Christy Ring Bridge.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Magnificent castle-like, listed gaol building, dating from the 19th Century, with

 Collection an excellent example of 19th century University architecture. Designed by Sir Thomas Deane, the main buildings were 
 ranged about three sides of a quadrangle. The English Market: A covered market selling a wide variety of goods and fresh produce.
