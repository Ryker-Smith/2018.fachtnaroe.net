 during the 19th century reveals the same alternation of successes and failures.  In 1800 the city contained 
 50 goldsmiths, while in 1853 it had none, and it is only in recent years that this industry is being again successfully
 worked here.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The manufacture of paper continued to decline steadily.  In 1837 paper mills were still working at Blarney,
 Dripsey and Bandon, affording employment to over 400 men.  Half a century later there were only two paper mills in the district
 and these were engaged only in the manufacture of wrapping paper.  Misfortune also dogged the steps of the iron and steel trades, 
 and to a lesser extent, of trhe shipbuilding industry.  Before the Famine the iron trade of the city employed nearly 1,000 men.  
 There were seven iron foundries, five firms engaged in the manufacture of spades and shovels, as well as two workshops for steel
 products.  The shipbuilding industry had improved considerably.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Up to 1837 underwriters were reluctant to insure ships built in Cork, but from that date onwards ships built here
 insured at low premiums.  In 1845 the Cork Steamship Co. employed 370 hands in building and repairing their own ships.  However, the
 effects of the Famine, taken in conjuction with the rapid development of these industries in Great Britain, reacted seriously against the iron,
 steel and shipbuilding trades of Cork.
