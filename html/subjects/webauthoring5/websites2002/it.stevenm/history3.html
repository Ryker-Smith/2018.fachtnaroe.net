<P><FONT COLOR="#BB0301">Damien Richardson took over as manager in the summer of '93 and one of his first tasks was a European Champions Cup tie against Welsh side Cwmbran Town.

The first leg started badly and City found themselves 3-0 down at half-time in Wales but second half goals from John Caulfield and Anthony Buckley set things up nicely for the home leg. That game was played at Turner's Cross and Johnny Glynn scored a late winner as the match finished 2-1, 4-4 on aggregate, so City went through to the next round on the away goals ruling.

They were given a tough draw, against Turkish Champions Galatasaray, and everyone was predicting the worst. Once again Dave Barry scored a vital European goal as City went down 2-1 in Istanbul. Despite a wonderful performance from City in Bishopstown they lost the second leg 1-0 to a late Kubilay goal. Galatasaray went on to knock Manchester United out of the competition as City were left wondering what might have been. 

On the domestic front the Munster Senior Cup remained in City's possession and in the league they finished runners-up for the second time.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#BB0301">The '94/'95 season was a poor one compared to the relative success of the previous few years. Once more City began the season in Europe. This time they faced Slavia Prague in the UEFA Cup and the Czech side proved to be the much stronger team as they won 6-0 on aggregate.

At home City won the League Cup, beating Dundalk 2-1 on aggregate in the final, and Billy Woods won the PFAI Young Player of the Year Award. 
Unfortunately there was very little else to cheer about as several home games had to be postponed due to problems with the Bishopstown pitch. A number of games were transferred to Turner's Cross and the FAI tried to make City play in Cobh. When they refused they were forced to play a home game in Dublin. 

The off-the-field troubles eventually led to Richardson's resignation, and Noel O'Mahoney was recruited for the rest of the season. It was an unenviable task and with Shamrock Rovers ending City's interest in the FAI Cup at an early stage the team finished the season in 7th place - their worst placing for six years.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#BB0301">A new manager was needed for the '95/'96 season and former Derby County player Rob Hindmarch was appointed player-manager. His first task was to reconstruct the team as injury robbed him of Liam Murphy, Declan Daly, Cormac Cotter and Dave Barry, while Billy Woods and Stephen Napier had moved on to Tranmere Rovers and Dundalk respectively. The club opted to bring in a number of English players with mixed success.

Unfortunately Hindmarch's task, difficult enough as it was, was compounded by the club's problems off the pitch. In March '96 the club went into receivership and thankfully were taken over by a consortium of local businessmen. They moved the club back to Turner's Cross and brought some much needed stability. Sligo Rovers knocked City out of the Cup and 9th place in the league was all they could manage. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#BB0301">In the summer of '96 Rob Hindmarch's contract was terminated and Dave Barry was signed up as player-manager, with Liam Murphy becoming his assistant. Although the season began badly with four straight losses there were encouraging signs as Dave and Liam employed a policy of using locally based players with a good blend of youth and experience.

City reached the League Cup Final where Galway United beat them 4-1 over the two legs and the Munster Senior Cup was reclaimed after a three year absence. Throughout the year City played attractive football and got their reward when they finished 4th and qualified for the Intertoto Cup.</P>
