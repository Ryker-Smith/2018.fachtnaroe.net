<FONT COLOR="#BB0301">City began the season by finishing third in the inaugural FAI Super Cup at the beginning of July. After losing their semi-final 2-1 to eventual winners Shamrock Rovers, City went on to beat Shelbourne 4-1 on penalties after the 3rd/4th place play-off finished one apiece. City used the tournament, which took place early in City's pre-season preparation, to give a number of reserve team players a taste of first team action. 
The club's pre-season preparations continued with a number of friendlies. City beat local sides St. Mary's (2-1), Cobh Ramblers (2-0), Glasheen United (7-0) before travelling to Kerry for a weekend where they beat Tralee Dynamos (1-0) and a Kerry DL Select side (1-0). Their only friendly defeat was to Swansea City, who visited Turner's Cross and won 2-0. 

<P>Then it was onto the European Cup Winners Cup, in which City were drawn against the unknown entity CSCA Kyiv, from the Ukraine, with the first leg at home. It was a memorable night at the Cross as City were 2-0 up at half time and dominated the visitors throughout the ninety minutes. However a late goal for CSCA was to prove decisive. In the return leg a 2-0 victory for the Ukrainians was enough to see them through to the next round, dashing City's dreams. 

<P>Back at home the League Cup group stage began in August and City comfortably dealt with Waterford United (2-1), Cobh Ramblers (2-0) and Kilkenny City (1-0). City started the league in equally confident fashion winning their first eight matches and, in fact, their only loss in the opening series of games was the away trip to St. Patrick's Athletic. That run of wins included impressive home drubbings of Dundalk (4-1) and Waterford United (5-0) aswell as some hard fought away victories like the 1-0 win in Bray, coming just three days after City returned from Kyiv, and the 2-0 victory in Sligo. 

<P>Meanwhile, in the League Cup they faced a difficult trip to Derry City in the quarter-finals but emerged triumphant thanks in no small part to Noel Mooney. The match finished 1-1 and went into extra-time when both teams scored once more sending the match to penalties. Noel Mooney saved three of Derry's spot-kicks to send the Leesiders into the semi-finals. That semi-final was a home tie against St. Patrick's Athletic and came just three days after Pat's beat City 2-0 in the league in Inchicore. Before a packed Turner's Cross, City gained revenge for that league defeat thanks to an early John Caulfield goal. 

<P>In the league the second series of games started well, with consecutive 3-0 wins over Shamrock Rovers and Bray Wanderers, but then a run of three draws and a loss allowed Pat's back into the title race as the two top teams increased their lead over the rest. At the same time the team had the two-legged League Cup final to concentrate on as City faced Shamrock Rovers. They came away from Tolka Park with a 1-1 draw, so the second leg, at the end of December, was nicely poised. Once more fans flocked to the Cross in the hope of seeing Declan Daly lifting another cup and they were not disappointed as a wonderful goal from Noel Hartigan won City their third League Cup. 

<P>Next up was a first round FAI Cup tie away to Monaghan United as City began their defence of the trophy they had won in memorable fashion the previous May. Despite the appalling weather conditions, City came away with a 2-0 win, both goals coming from John Caulfield. Then it was back to the league and City beat Waterford and Sligo and drew away to Finn Harps in advance of their clash with Pat's at the Cross. That match at the end of January was to prove vital: City dominated the first half but only had a single Pat Morley goal to show for their efforts. In the second half, St. Pat's change of tactics gave them the upper-hand and they won the game 2-1. 

<P>There was further disappointment for City in February as Finn Harps knocked the Leesiders out of the FAI Cup in a second round replay in Ballybofey. In the league it was neck and neck at the top of the table with City and Pat's matching each other stride for stride - all eyes focused on the pairs final clash of the season at Richmond Park on April 16th. It was looking increasingly likely that those ninety minutes would be needed to separate the two best teams in the country and that was how it turned out. The match was full of talking points including a sending-off and a controversial "goal" that wasn't, as Pat's won 1-0 and City and their fans returned to Cork dejected. It meant that in the final two matches Pat's had only to equal Cork's performances to be crowned champions for the third time in the 1990s. While City won both their games so did Pat's so the league trophy remained in Inchicore for another year. 

<P>City's final two games were at home and they were memorable occasions. The first was a 2-1 win over Shelbourne which will long be remembered for the half-time antics of Shels sub Alan Gough who invaded The Shed in search of his ball. City fans turned out in force for the final match of the season and the team did not disappoint as they crushed Shamrock Rovers, scoring three goals without reply. The crowd remained for twenty minutes after the final whistle calling for the team who did come back onto the pitch to greet the fans. And as Deccie Daly stood on The Shed wall he uttered those immortal words "Same time, same place, next year!"
