<P><FONT COLOR="#BB0301">The '89/'90 season started with a two-legged showdown with Torpedo Moscow. Although City lost both games, 5-0 away and 1-0 at home, it was a proud achievement for such a young club.

On the domestic front City were knocked out of the FAI Cup at the quarter-final stage by Bohemians and in the league they continued to improve position by finishing 5th, picking up the Munster Senior Cup along the way. </P>
 
 
 

<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><B>1990-91</B>
 
<P><FONT COLOR="#BB0301">The '90/'91 season was one of the most remarkable in the club's existence as they led the league for all but the final week. They began the season by embarking on a 20-match unbeaten run. At home they won 5 and drew 5, scoring 9 and conceding 3, while on their travels they won 6 and drew 4, scoring a remarkable 17 and conceding only 4. 

That phenomenal sequence ended in equally sensational fashion as Shamrock Rovers crushed City 4-0 in Dublin on the 20th of January. After that fateful day in the RDS City went 11 games unbeaten before Dundalk pipped them for the title on the last day.

There could be little consolation taken from the retention of the Munster Senior Cup or the individual recognition that Pat Morley received when voted the PFAI Player of the Year.</P>
 
 
 

<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><B>1991-92</B> 
 
<P><FONT COLOR="#BB0301">The '91/'92 season saw City enter the UEFA Cup for the first time and they were rewarded with a prime draw against German giants Bayern Munich.The first leg, at home, was played in Musgrave Park and, though the odds were stacked in the Germans favour, City produced arguably the best performance in their history to date.

City surprised the Germans when they took the lead through Dave Barry as Noel O'Mahony's clever tactics paying off. But on the stroke of half-time Stefan Effenberg fired in an equaliser from thirty yards.

In the return leg in Munich, Cork held the Germans scoreless for 75 minutes, but eventually lost 2-0. In the league City continued to impress and finished 3rd, having led for much of the season. They retained the Munster Senior Cup and made it to the FAI Cup Final where Bohemians beat them 1-0.</P>
 
 
 

<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><B>1992-93</B> 
 
<P><FONT COLOR="#BB0301">1992/1993 was the season that City moved to Bishopstown and it was also the year that the League Championship returned to Leeside, for the first time since Cork Celtic won it in 1974, as City claimed the title in extraordinary circumstances. 

On the final day of the season City beat Limerick 3-0, Bohemians lost 2-0 to Dundalk while Shelbourne beat Derry 1-0 with a last minute goal, which meant that all three finished on the same number of points resulting in a series of home and away play-offs. However, these failed to resolve the situation as all three won one, drew 2 and lost one of their four games. 

A second set of play-offs was then needed, this time the teams would meet each other once, on neutral ground. City drew first blood as a Pat Morley goal gave them a 1-0 win over Bohs at Turner's Cross. They were ready to bring the trophy South the following Saturday, May 22nd, when they faced Shels at the RDS. They beat them 3-2 in one of the most exciting League of Ireland games ever. 

Pat Morley opened the scoring but Gary Haylock scored an equaliser from the penalty spot in the 40th minute. 10 minutes into the second half Shels had a man sent-off and City took full advantage as Dave Barry fired them into the lead. 10 minutes later Shels drew level again, this time through Anto Whelan but 16 minutes from time Paul Bannon appeared on the scene to score the most important goal in the club's history. 

The Munster Senior Cup was once more retained and Morley gained more individual recognition, this time as Soccer Writers Association of Ireland Personality of the Year.</P>
