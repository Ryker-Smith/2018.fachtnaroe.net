<div align="Justify">Perhaps one of the best known and best loved in Cork is the church.  It was built in 1722 as a chapel of ease to St. Mary's Shandon, which was 
located nearby in Mallow Lane, now called Shandon Street.  It is believed there was a church on this site at least as early as 1199.  The church occupies the site of the old 
Church of St Mary that was destroyed in the siege of Cork in 1690.  A temporary church was built at the foot of Shandon Street for some years until the present church was built.
Here stands St Anne's Church, with its trademark salmon-shaped weather vane.The salmon is sometimes described as the red fish, the liberty fish, the foul fish, or simply the fish". 
Sometimes, 'salmon' being a taboo word, it was called 'The Beast'. The weather-cock on the top of St. Anne's Church is a giant salmon, indicating the importance of the fishing industry 
of the River Lee to the citizenry of two centuries ago.<p> The church dates from the early 18th century.  Erected by public subscription it is built primarily 
of local sandstone with limestone dressing.  The tower wasnt added until 1750 and the church gained full parochial status in 1772.
Some of the more striking features of the church include:<i>The Tower, The Clock and the Bells</i>Visitors can ring the church's famous bells and can climb to the top for views of the city.
The interior is Georgian in style.<p> 
The Church has a simple Renaissance interior which provides a peaceful atmosphere for worship.  St. Anne's Shandon is the Protestant Church of Ireland church of Shandon Bells fame. It is easily 
confused with St. Anne's the Catholic Cathedral which is within a stones throw of it. There is no cemetery attached to St Anne's Church.  Famous for its giant pepperpot steeple and its eight melodious bells, 
this is Cork's prime landmark.</div>
