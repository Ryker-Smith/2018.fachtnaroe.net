<DIV align=justify>The church in architectural terms is best known for its 
three-storey tower, over 170 feet high with walls 13 feet thick, with a copper 
dome that is a vane in the form of a salmon. Nine feet high the 'fish of 
Shandon' remains one of the most familiar features on the Cork landscape. The 
weather vane on top is in the form of a golden fish, a salmon 13 feet high. The 
fish symbolizes the salmon industry in the River Lee. Beneath the fish is the 
peeper pot shaped lantern surmounted by a lead dome and four points of the 
compass. The square tower itself is 120 feet high.

<DIV align=justify>The tower is unique in that two of its faces are of white 
limestone and two are of res sandstone. The limestone faces South and West to 
the limestone country while the sandstone faces North and East to the sandstone 
country Tradition has it that the limestone came from the ruins of Shandon 
Castle and the limestone from the Franciscan Abbey on the north Mall.<BR>A local 
rhyme describes it as:<BR>. <I>'Party-coloured, like its people,</I><BR><I>Red 
and white stands Shandon Steeple'</I><BR>The McOsterich family were involved 
with the design and erection of this tower and to this day a special privilege 
is afforded them. Whenever a member of the family marries, anywhere in the 
world, the bells ring out in their honour.

<DIV align=justify>The walls of the Tower at the base are 7 feet thick and the 
height to the viewing balcony is 120 feet, add to this another 50 feet for our 
pepper pot.<BR>
