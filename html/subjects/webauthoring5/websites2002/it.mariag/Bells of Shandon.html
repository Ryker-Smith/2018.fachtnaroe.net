Cast by Abel Rudhall of Glouster in 1750 they were placed in position in the tower in 1752. One of the bells bears the inscription ‘We were all cast at Gloustcester in England. Abel Rdhall, 1750’.</P> The bells were a gift presented by Daniel Thresher and weighted over 6 tons. Although four of the bells have been recast over time, one in 1869 and the others in 1908, they all retain their original inscriptions.

The bells first rang out over the city on December 7th 1752 for the marriage of Henry Harding and Catherine Dorman. They were re-casted in 1865 and in 1906 they were hung in a fixed position so as to reduce vibration. It was said that when the bells were rung in a swinging position the patients in the local hospital, the North Infirmary Charitable Hospital shook in their beds.</P>

The original inscriptions on each bells reads:

               When us you ring we'll sweetly sing

               God preserve the Church and King

               Health and prosperity to all our benefactors

               Peace and good neighbourhood

               Prosperity to the city and trade thereof

               We were all cast at Gloucester in England by Abel Rudhall 1750

               Since generosity has opened our mouths our tongues shall sing aloud its praise                                                             

               I to the Church the living call and to the grave do summon all

The last bell, the tenor, weighs 26cwt. and also bears the name Daniel Thresher, a great benefactor of the Church, who, in his will, left money to provide this bell. It was the same Daniel Thresher who provided the Church of St Anne with a single bell before the peal was introduced. This bell, dated 1745, now hangs in the Church of St. Mary in Sundays Well. Our world famous bells can be rung on the first floor of St Annes Church.
