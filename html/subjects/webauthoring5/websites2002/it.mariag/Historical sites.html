</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the time of Saint Finbarr a strong religious tradition has existed in Cork. As the city developed as an important trading port from medieval times various religious sites were established. Medieval documents testify to the establishment of a number of religious foundations in the city from the 11th century. A papal document dated 1199, in which Innocent 111 confirms the Bishop of Cork with various privileges mention is made of 8 churches in the city. A Benedictine priory appears to have existed by 1191; the parish church of St Peters by 1199 and three friaries were founded in the early 13th century – the Dominicans, the Augustinians and Franciscans. In the will of John de Wychedon (1309) 15 churches are mentioned.

By the time of the Reformation six monastic establishments were founded outside the walls of the medieval town. Apart from the churches built by religious orders parish churches such as Shandon were also established at an early stage. 

As Shandon lay just outside the walled medieval city a number of churches were built in the area from medieval times.Manuscript sources refer to a parish church, ‘St. Mary, Schendona in 1306. The first recorded instance of a church being built in the parish was in 1624 with further references to a church in 1635. Referred to as a baptismal church it was believed to have been in Coppinger’s Lane. Abandoned around 1644, a second church dating from 1700 was established in what is now known as Old Chapel Lane. It is believed that this was converted into a school circa 1730 and a third church, known as ‘the Bishop’s Chapel, was built on the site now occupied by the Pro-Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne’s. 

With the advent of the Reformation churches in the city were taken over by the state and Catholic services were provided from a number of temporary sites. Over time churches associated with various Protestant denominations, particularly the Church of Ireland, were established in the area most notably St Anne’s Shandon. 

Further developments also took place with the resurgence of the commercial catholic middle class and growth of the Catholic Church following the demise of the Penal Laws.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The growing prosperity of the city brought about by its manufacturing and trade resulted in a growing wealthy commercial class funding church building programmes. New religious orders came to the city such as the Capuchins, and Vincentians and they also began to establish churches in the city and existing orders built new churches or modified existing ones.

Over the centuries churches in the area were destroyed in times of conflict or by natural disasters such as fire. New churches were built on the same site or existing churches were renovated or added to.

The 19th century saw a period of building and renewal of churches such as the Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne’s and the Dominican church St Mary’s in Popes Quay. These were then subsequently added on to and renovated over time.
