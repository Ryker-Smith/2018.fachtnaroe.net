<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">It is believed there was a church on this site at least as early as 1199. The church occupies the site of the old Church of St Mary that was destroyed in the siege of Cork in 1690. A temporary church was built at the foot of Shandon Street for some years until the present church was built. Erected by public subscription it is built primarily of local sandstone with limestone dressing. The tower was added until 1750 and the church gained full parochial status in 1772.</P>Its enduring image is due in no small part to Francis Sylvester O’Mahony or Father Prout and his song  ‘The Bells of Shandon’. While the bells may its best-known feature the clocks on each side of the tower and itsdominance over the skyline in Shandon are also striking features of the church.
