<BR>
The clock, known to Corkonians the world over as 
"The Four Faced Liar" on account of the time being slightly different on each 
face during the hour. 
<BR>
The reason for this is, the numbers on the faces are made 
of wood and gilded, some of the wood is thicker than others and so some hands stick 
when they reach these numbers, but on the hour they all come together.

The Fish 
</H3>

The fish is painted in Gold Leaf and is approximately 13 feet in length. 
It represents the Lord, in that, in the old days the Lord's name was 
signified by the sign of a fish. 
<BR>
It also represents the Salmon Fishing on the local river Lee and in Irish 
Mythology the salmon was the "Fish of Knowledge". 
Today it is used as a weather vane. 
<BR>
It is called "De Goldie Fish" by Corkonians and people in the Northside live under 
"De Goldie Fish".
