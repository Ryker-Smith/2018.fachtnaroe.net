Welcome to the Church of St. Anne Shandon, one of Ireland's most famous Christian landmarks.

</B>
<P>
Since the 6th century there has been a Christian witness in this place. 
Before St. Finbarre, the patron saint of our city, 
established his College of Learning at Gillabbey Street in the 7th century, 
where now stands the magnificent Cathedral dedicated to his name, 
there has been a Church on this site.
