<P>

Since the 6th century there has been a Christian witness in this place. 
Before St. Finbarre, the patron saint of our city, 
established his College of Learning at Gillabbey Street in the 7th century, 
where now stands the magnificent Cathedral dedicated to his name, 
there has been a Church on this site. 

<P>

The name Shandon comes from the Irish, Sean Dun, and means Old Fort. 
Shandon was one of 28 settlements in and around ancient Cork. 
A medieval Church dedicated to St. Mary existed on this site 
and is mentioned in the decretals of Pope Innocent 3rd in 1199 as 
"St. Mary on the Mountain" and this stood until the 
Williamite wars when the siege of Cork (1690) brought about its destruction.

In 1693 this was replaced by a Church, also dedicated to St. Mary, 
and was located at the bottom of Mallow Lane, modern day Shandon Street. 
Due to population growth, it was decided to build anew on this ancient site 
and so in 1722 the present Church of St. Anne Shandon was constructed. 

<P>

It is built with two types of stone, red sandstone from the original Shandon 
castle which stood nearby and limestone taken from the derelict Franciscan Abbey which 
stood on the North Mall. As you approach Shandon, from all directions, 
you will see both coloured stone of red/white and such is the affection that Shandon 
holds in the hearts of the citizens of Cork that they designated both colours to represent 
the City. 

<P>

St. Anne Shandon had to wait until 1772 to attain full parochial status when 
Rev. Arthur Hyde was appointed its first Rector. Arthur was the great-great-grandfather 
of Dr. Douglas Hyde, pioneer of the Gaelic revival and the first 
President of the Irish Free State.
