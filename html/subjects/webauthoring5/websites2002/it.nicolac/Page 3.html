Blarney Woolen Mills were developed by the Mahoney Family in 1824. The industry prospered and by<BR>
the mid 1830's, a few years before the famine, the mill employed 120 people, and had to be<BR>
extended substantially in the 1840's. The presence of the mill shielded Blarney from the worst effects<BR>
of the famine and few deaths were recorded in the area during that national<BR>
catastrophe. The success story at the mills continued until a disastrous fire in 1869, a few weeks before<BR>
Christmas when much of the mill was gutted.<BR><BR>
By August 1871 the mill was once again operational with a labour force of 222. Employment continued to<BR>
grow and it reached 600 by 1881 and 700 by 1950. The mills closed due to recession in the textile<BR>
industry. In 1976 the late Christy Kelleher, who had himself had been a mill worker, bought the old mill<BR>
property. In short period of time Christy and his family transformed the mill into one of the finest<BR>
gift and craft retail centres in the world, a restaurant and a hotel.<BR><BR>
