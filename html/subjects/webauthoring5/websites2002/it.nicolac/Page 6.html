St. Finbarre's Cathedral is a striking finely proportioned early French Gothic building with three spires; the central
spire is 240ft in height and the twin spires are 180ft. It has a peel of eight bells and contains some fine carvings
and has a very rich west front. The central doorway is a splendid one depicting the five wise and the five foolish virgins
coming to meet the Bridegroom. All the carvings of the building were cast in plaster being permitted by the Architect,
William Burgess, to be committed to stone. Architecturally it must surely be the finest building in the city, forming as
it does a massive architectural pile standing on the high outcrop overlooking the city. Externally and internally the carvings
statues and gargoyles are a wealth of liturgical symbolism meriting time and study.<BR><BR>
