The foundation stone of the City Hall, erected on the site of the former building was laid by Mr. de Valera, president of the <BR>
Executive Council of the State on the 9th July, 1932. The building consists of three sections, two wings comprising the Municipal<BR>
Offices and an assembly hall, capable of seating 1,300 people. The first occupation of the building took place in March, 1935, when<BR>
 the staffs of a number of the Departments moved into the western wing. The first meeting of An Bardas was held in the new building on<BR>
the 24th April, 1935. The building was formerly opened by the President on 8th September, 1936.<BR><BR>
The building is designed on classic lines to harmonise with the examples of 18th century architecture and the modern buildings, fundamentally<BR>
Georgian in character, that so richly endow Cork City. It is an imposing and dignified structure, and, with it's long main front dominating<BR>
the river, immediately attracts attention by reason of the excellence of its proportion and the simplicity of its treatment. The facades are of dressed
limestone from the Little Island (Co. Cork) Quarries.<BR><BR>
Busts, by Seamus Murphy, R.H.A., of Lord Mayors Tomas MacCurtain and Terence MacSwiney were unveiled in the vestibule by Comhairleoir
S. MacCarthy, T.D., Lord Mayor, on 28th June 1964. The main entrance to the offices is through a marble paved vestibule to the main<BR>
staircase hall. The stairs are of polished marble and the balustrading of ornamental hammered wrought iron. On the first floor over the<BR>
entrance are the principal departments which form the Lord Mayor's suite. The Council Chamber on the other side of the corridor is <BR>
approached through a lobby. This chamber is well conceived, being both lofty and spacious. It is naturally lighted from an ornamental<BR>
dome. Galleries have been provided for distinguished visitors and the general public. Here much freedom has been displayed both in <BR>
decorative and plaster work and in the ballustrading, the walls being in panelled mahogany. The furnishing of the chamber is also of<BR>
mahogany to the Architect's designs.<BR><BR>
A plaque, by Seamus Murphy, R.H.A., bearing a profile of the late President Kennedy erected over the main entrance door of the City<BR>
Hall vestibule was unveiled by the Lord Mayor, Comhairleoir S. MacCarthy, T.D., on 29th June, 1964.<BR><BR>
Another plaque by Seamus Murphy, R.H.A., lists the first members of Council of the County Borough of Cork<BR>
to be a Republican Majority.<BR><BR>
A Visitor's Book listing recipients of the Freedom of the City is available for inspection by interested parties.<BR><BR>
