<BODY> St. Anne's Shandon is without a doubt Cork's most famous attraction,<BR>
 but known more for it's bells than the structure that houses them.<BR>
 The church was built in 1726 on the site of an earlier church, which had been destroyed <BR>
during the 1690 attack on the city. The church's fame is due primarily to the famous song. <BR>
the Bells of Shandon written by Francis Sylvester Mahony (a.k.a. Fr. Prout). Fr. Prout was <BR>
born in 1804 and wrote the song while studying at the Jesuit College in Rome. He died in <BR>
Paris in 1866 and within earshot of the Bells. <BR><BR>
The Tower is unusual in that the two of it's sites are white and two red. Like most of <BR>
Cork's buildings, it is built of limestone and sandstone. The receeding stages on top <BR>
of the tower, the final stage with a dome, give the church it's distinctive appearance. <BR>
The weather vane on top is in the form of a gold fish. <BR><BR>
But it is the bells that bring visitors to Shandon. One of the eight bells bears the <BR>
<I>We were all cast at Gloucester in England. Abel Radhall, 1750.</I> Although the narrow<BR>
streets sometimes make Shandon hard to find, visitors can reward themselves by playing <BR>
the bells or by climbing to the first stage of the tower to experience the wonderful <BR>
view it commands of the city. <BR><BR>
