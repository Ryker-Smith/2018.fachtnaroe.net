 The Fitzgerald Park is a beautiful area of over 18 acres which has been greatly improved in recent years and which includes<BR>
a fine display of flowers in both formal bedding and informal arrangements, together with a decorative pond with aquatic<BR>
plants and a Children's Playground. Within the Park is housed Cork Museum. This Park, ideally situated alongside the river overlooked by the<BR>
of Sunday's Well, was the site of the Cork International Exhibition of 1902/03. It is entered by the Mardyke, a tree-lined promenade nearly<BR>
a mile long at the Western side of the City, which gives access also to the Cork Cricket Club Grounds, the Sunday's Well Boating and Tennis<BR>
Club, and the University College Football and Athletic Grounds. It was formed in 1720 by Mr. Edward Webber, then Town Clerk of Cork.<BR><BR>
