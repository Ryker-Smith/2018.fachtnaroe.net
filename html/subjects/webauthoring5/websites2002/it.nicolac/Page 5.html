The General Post Office is a handsome, finely-cut, silvery limestone facade rounding into Pembroke Street. It was on this side that two of<BR>
Cork's famous theatres stood. The first goes back to the late 1750's when Spranger Barry came to Cork from the "Crow Street Company", Dublin,<BR>
to establish a playhouse as part of an enterprise to secure the control of the Irish theatres. It was opened on Monday July 1st, 1760, under the<BR>
auspices of the Theatre Royal and the curtains rose to the tragedy play "The Orphans".<BR><BR>
The erection of the theatre was made possible by the assistance of 40 subscribers each contributing £50, then receiving in return a solid silver<BR>
transferable ticket bearing 4% interest and admission for an indefinite period. The theatre was modelled after the "Crow Street Theatre" and also<BR>
resembled it in dimensions being 136ft in length and 60ft in width. For eighty years the citizens of Cork revelled in their enjoyment of the theatre<BR>
until the building, wardrobes etc. were destroyed by fire after a performance on April 1st, 1840.<BR><BR>
The second theatre was built in 1863 retaining the old name of "The Theatre Royal". During the mid '60's it was much improved extending its accommodation<BR>
to seat 2,000 patrons. Mr. R.C. Burke was the builder and leasee. The theatre was remodelled from the designs under the direction of Sir John Benson - the<BR>
Cork based architect. The refurbished and enlarged Theatre Royal reopened on December 26th, 1867. The outstanding attractions to grace the satge during the<BR>
early years of the 1870's were appearances of the famous actor Barry Sullivan, the English Opera and the Opera Bouffe.<BR><BR>
The theatre flourished until 1875 when it was sold to the postal authority. After much alteration it opened two years later as<BR>
Cork General Post Office replacing a much smaller one on Pembroke Street.
