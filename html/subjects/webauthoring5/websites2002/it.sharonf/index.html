<FONT FACE="Garmond"><DIV ALIGN="Justify"><BASEFONT SIZE="4">St. Anne's Shandon is without a doubt Corks most famous attraction.
The church was built in 1726 on the site of an earlier church,which had been destroyed during the attack on the city in 1690.
The churchs fame is due to the famous song, "The Bells of Shandon" written by Fr. Francais Prout while studing at the Jesuit College in Rome.
The tower is unusual in that two of its sides are white and two red.Like most of Corks buildings it is made of limestone and sandstone.
The receeding stages on top of the tower and the final stage with a dohme, give the church its distinctive appearance.
The weather vane on top is in the form of a goldfish.But its the bells that bring visitors to Shandon.
One of the eight bells bear the inscription "We were all cast at Glouscester Abel Rdhall, 1750"
Although the narrow streets find Shandon hard to find,visitors can reward themselves by playing the bells 
or by climbing the tower to expereince the wonderful
view of the city.<BR></FONT></FONT></DIV>
