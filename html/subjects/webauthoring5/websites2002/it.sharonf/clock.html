The clock on St. Anne's church was one of the first public clocks in
Cork city. Councillor Delay proposed the idea for the clock at a meeting
of Cork Corporation in 1843. He was supported by some of the medical profession
as they argued that many poor people were in danger of poisionong themselves
by not knowing the times when prescribed medication should be taken. Many
working class people were unable to tell the time as most of them did not own
watches or clocks.</FONT></FONT>

In May 1843 it was agreed that £250 be provided for the design and constructionof the clock. 
James Mangan, assisted by his son, was chosen to design the clock. 
Daniel Thresher built the clock at a cost of £18!In 1847, the clock was installed in the church.</DIV></FONT>

The clock was known to the Corkonians as the "Four Faced Liar" on account of the time 
being different on each face duringthe hour. The reason for this was that the faces are
made of wood and glided, some of the wood is thicker than others ans so some hands stick
when they reach these thick numbers, but on the hour they all come together.</DIV><BR>
