With deep affection,and recollection,<BR>   
I often think of those Shandon bells.<BR>   
Whose sounds so wild would, in the days of childhood,<BR>   
Fling around my cradle their magic spells,<BR>   
On this I ponder where'er I wander,<BR>    
And thus grow fonder sweet Cork of thee;<BR>   
With thy bells of Shandon that sound so grand on<BR>   
The pleasant waters of the River Lee.<BR>

The eight bells, were made by Rudhalls of Gloucester. They weigh over 6 tons and they first rang out over the city on December 7th, 1752 for the marriage of Henry Harding and Catherine Dorman.
They were recasted in 1865 and in 1906 they were hung in a fixed position so as to reduce vibration. It was said that when the bells were rung the patients in the local hospital, the North infirmary Charitable Hospital shook in their
beds. The bells retail the original inscription on them:<BR>
<BR>
<LI> When us you ring we'll sweetly sing.
<LI> God preserve the Church and King.
<LI> Health and prosperty to all our benefactors.
<LI> Peace and good neighbourhood.
<LI> Prospery to the city and trade thereof.
<LI> We were all cast at Gloucester in England by Abel Rudhall 1750.
<LI> Since generosity has opened our mouths our tongues shall sing aloud its praise.
<LI> I to the Church the living call and to the grave do summon all.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
The last bell, the tenor, weighs 26cwt and bears the name Daniel Thresher
(a grest benefactor of the church.) The bells can be rung on
the first floor of the tower. Also on the first floor, two statues may be seen. These are
called Bob and Joan. These were figures on the pillars of the Greencoat School,which was behind the Church.
The school closed in the 1950's.</P></DIV></FONT></FONT><BR>
