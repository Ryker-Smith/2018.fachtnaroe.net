This present Church was erected in 1722, but way back in the time when Cork City was a collection of 13 islands and inhabited by 28 tribes, 
this site here bore Christian witness to the world. 
In the decretals of Pope Innocent the third in 1199, this church was mentioned as St. Mary on the mountain. 
The name Shandon is derived from the Gaelic <B>Sean Dun</B> meaning Old Fort and this area was the Old Fort area of the city. 
Where now stands the Firkin Crane Center once stood Shandon Castle or Barrys castle later to become the home of British Government in the province of Munster.<BR>
In the siege of Cork in 1690, the castle and the original church were razed to the ground by Williamite forces under the command of the Duke of Marlborough. 
When the present church was being built the Red Sandstone from Shandon castle and the White or Grey Limestone from the Franciscian Friary in the North Mall were both used. 
Northern and Eastern sides were built with Red Sandstone and Southern and Western sides were built with white or grey limestone, signifying the regions of Cork in which the stone was quarried. 
It is from these two coloured stones that Cork City takes its sporting colours.<BR>

On the left hand side of the church you will see the <B>Raising of Lazarus</B> and this is a memorial to the McDonald family, 
whose descendant,John Ramsey, went on to become the first Prime Minister of Canada.
Behind the alter is the <B>Transfiguration</B>, a memorial to the Wood family, executed by Watson Stained Glass of Youghal. 
On the right hand side of the church is the Good Samaritian and it was executed by
Mayler of Munich and London.</P>

At the back of the church is a memorial to Rev. George Barton who died in 1832 at the age of 30 while helping those afflicted with Cholera.
This disease marked the first decline in our population.
The church has some 17th centuary books. 
Some of these books came from the first library in the city and some came from Greencoat school, which was situated behind the church. One of the authors of these books is John Donne who was a powerful preacher. 
There is also a memorial to the parishoners who gave their lives in the Great War of 1914-1918.</P>
