<TD WIDTH="2000">The all-round midfielder that any manager would love to have, be it at club or country level. Roy Keane has boundless energy and puts every ounce of it into his fearsome ball-winning tackles. A versatile player who can operate at right back or as an old-fashioned centre half as well as in his preferred defensive midfield role, "Spuds" has also assumed the mantle of captain for both Manchester United and the Republic of Ireland, relishing the role of a leader of men and taking his team to greater heights by means of his inspirational play He won his first cap for the Republic of Ireland in 1991 and was an integral part of the team that made it through to the last 16 at USA 94. Coach Mick McCarthy named him captain at the start of the qualifying campaign for the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan and Keane revelled in the task, leading his troops to Far East despite the toughest of draws that saw the Republic paired with UEFA EURO 2000 semi-finalists Portugal and the Netherlands. 
 
His crowning moment was the 1-0 home victory over the Dutch which clinched second place in the group. Keane's work-rate was phenomenal, particularly after his side was reduced to ten men with half-an-hour still to play. This match saw him prove his worth both as a player and as an inspirational captain.
