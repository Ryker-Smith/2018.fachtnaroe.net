<TD WIDTH="2000">Manchester United's Mr Versatile Roy Keane has played at right-back, in central defence and in every midfield position for Alex Ferguson since he was signed from Nottingham Forest in the summer of 1993 for a then record between British clubs of £3.75 million.
His favoured position is in the centre of midfield where he can drive United from penalty area to penalty area with his non-stop play.

A former amateur boxer, Keane has been in trouble with referees throughout his career, culminating in the public shame that came with his FA Cup semi-final sending-off in 1995, when he stamped on Gareth Southgate, at a time when football was appealing for calm following the death of a Palace supporter.

Keane described the incident with Southgate as his "two minutes of madness" and he ended up with a three match ban and a £5,000 fine from the FA.

Ferguson also fined Keane a week's wages in December 1993 after he was involved in an incident at an East Midlands night club.

Ferguson saw Keane as the ideal replacement for Bryan Robson and gave Forest a huge profit on the £25,000 they paid Irish side Cobh Ramblers, when he came to England in the summer of 1990. When United put in their bid it took Cork-born Keane little time to make up his mind despite interest from European giants Barcelona and Real Madrid.

His performances earned respect from managers and players throughout Europe and he was picked out for Diego Maradona for special praise. "Buy him," said Maradona while watching Keane - "together we play good."

He said: "It was no contest, I supported Spurs as a kid but the rest of my family were United daft. I don't think I would have a family left if I'd signed for them."

Keane wrote unsuccessfully to English clubs, including Forest, before being picked up by Cobh Ramblers but once he arrived at the City Ground, Brian Clough quickly pushed him into the first team, with a debut against Liverpool.

A product of the Irish equivalent of the School of Excellence, he was one of three United players to feature in the World Cup finals in 1994, after winning his first cap for the Republic of Ireland in 1991, emerging with a crop of other youngsters, including Jason McAteer, Gary Kelly and goalkeeper Alan Kelly.

Roy has now a healthy collection of medals from his time at United, and two 'doubles' under his belt. Mick McCarthy recently named Keane the captain of the Republic Of Ireland, and with his improved disclipinary record, the captaincy of Manchester United is not beyond him.
