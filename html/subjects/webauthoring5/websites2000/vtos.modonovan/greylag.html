<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Geese are large migratory birds
which are found only in the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere. They
are social birds, gathering in large flocks in the autumn and winter. Each
flock is made up of many closely-knit family units. They have long necks
like swans. Geese feed mostly by grazing and because of this they are much
better adapter to walking on land than are swans. Their legs are longer
and their feet smaller. Their bill is serrated, like a saw, to enable them
to pluck grass from the ground. There are many different types of geese
throughout the world and about ten types are found in Europe. Of this ten,
six are regularly found in Ireland. These are the greylag goose, the Greenland
white-fronted goose, the pin-footed goose, the barnacal goose, and the
Canada goose. The greylag goose is the only species of wild goose which
thought ever to have bred in this country. It seems to have got its name
from the fact that it lagged behind after other geese migrated North in
spring. Only feral greylags now nest here, in two places: at Castlecoole,
Co Fermanagh, and in Strangford Lough, Co Down. The nearest place to Ireland
where wild greylags now nest is in Northern Scotland.</font></font>

<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>These geese are grey-brown and
light in colour on the belly. The feathers have white tips so that the
bird has a striped or mottled appearance. The bill is orange and the feet
and legs are pink. The average bird weighs about three to four kilos. Greylags
are birds of the open country they are as happy on land as they are in
the air, though of course they also spend a lot of time on water. They
migrate in skeins (small flocks) keeping a V-shaped formation and with
an old bird leading the way. They leave their breeding grounds in Iceland,
Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe in the autumn to spend the winter in warmer
countries of Southern and Western Europe.&nbsp; In the past as many as
10,000 greylags could be counted on the Slobs of Wexford, but now only
an occasional bird is seen there. Irelands present total population is
estimated at only 1,000birds. We do not know the exact reason why we have
fewer greylag geese nowadays, but the drainage of&nbsp; many wetland areas
in recent years and increasing human disturbance must have a lot to do
with it. The main haunts for greylags are at Broad Lough and Poulaphouca
Reservoir, Co Wicklow, at Coolfin in Waxford and on Lambay Island, off
Dublin, all on the East coast. In addition, a flock of 200 usually spends
the winter on the shores of Lough Foyle. Though the graylag is a shy wary
bird in the world, it is easily tamed.Almost all the domestic breeds of
geese are descended from wild greylags.</font></font>
