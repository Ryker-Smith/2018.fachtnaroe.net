<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Seven of the ducks found in Ireland
are known as dabbling ducks or surface-feeding ducks. They are: teal, mallard,
wigeon, pintail, shoveler, gadwall, and gargany. Dabbling ducks get their
name from their habit of feeding in shallow water. They feed on seeds and
water plants, and they reach them by “up-ending” --– putting their heads
under the surface and their tails in the air. The adult birds never dive
for food, but the ducklings do so regurlary. Dabbling ducks moult twice
a year. During the moult they cannot fly and they move to a quiet place
where they can remain undisturbed. They breed when they are one year old.
One good way of recognising a dabbling duck is by watching the way it takes
off from the water. It will jump out of the water in one leap and fly off
whereas other ducks run along the surface to take off.</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>The teal is a common duck in Ireland.
It is also the smallest European duck at only 35-cm long from the tip of
its tail to the tip of its bill. The drake, the male bird, has a bright
green, yellow and brown head, a pale brown chest with black flecks on it,
and grey flanks and wings. On the water he has a white stripe visible above
the wing and a yellow patch on the tail. The female bird, or duck, is speckled
brown with a green patch on the wing. The bill is quiet long.</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Teal are extremely fast flyers
and they are very quick in all their movements. Their flight is often very
erratic. You will find them mostly on inland ponds, marshes and streams
where they feed mainly on water plants. They breed on rushy moorland and
beside bog pools where there is plenty of vegetation. They are more difficult
to observe than mallard and the young ducklings do not often venture out
into open water. They prefer to hide in reed beds and keep out of sight.
Teal nest throughout most of Ireland except for the south and southwest
of the country. They lay eight to twelve eggs of a greenish-grey in colour.
If you happen to stumble on a teal’s nest, the female will try to distract
your attention by pretending to be injured.</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;In the autumn a very large
number of teal come into Ireland from their main breeding grounds further
north. They come from Iceland, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Russia and from
Britain to spend the winter here. The best place to see these birds is
the muddy channel beside the North Bull Island, in Dublin Bay. This is
a very important feeding ground for wildfowl and wading birds that spend
the winter here. Up to 1,200 teal can be found there in the month of January.
This is now three times as many as three was twenty years ago. Teal are
vegetarians and live mostly on the saltmarsh plant called grasswort during
their visit to the Bull. It is very plentiful there.</font></font>
