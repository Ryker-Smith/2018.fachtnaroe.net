<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The goose of Ireland is the white-fronted goose,
so called because of the large white patch on the forehead and face. It
is very similar to the greylag but it is smaller and more delicate in shape.
The race found here is a particular type of white-fronted goose known as
the Greenland white-fronted goose. It is very dark in colour, and sometimes
the belly, head and neck are almost black. The bill is an orange-yellow
colour and the legs are orange.</font></b>

This race of geese nests on the west coast of Greenland. The nests are
made close to a lake or marshy spot in low country. Each pair has its own
territory which it defends against intruders. The eggs are laid towards
the end of May. They are incubated by the goose (the mother bird) whilst
the gander (the father) stays close by. Neither bird feeds very much during
the incubation period and both loose a lot of weight. When the young birds
(goslings) hatch, their parents take them down to the lake where there
is plenty of food. When alarmed the whole family takes to the water. The
young birds are able to fly in July or early August when they are about
five weeks old. At the age of ten to twelve weeks, the family is ready
to make the long 3,000 kilometer journey to Ireland. Ireland is the most
important wintering ground in the world for this type of goose. About 9,000
birds spend the winter here, arriving at the end of September and staying
until April. White-fronts likes good pasture land with plenty of water
close by. Most of their favourite areas are found in the west of the country.</font></b>

The White-fronted geese are found above all, on the Slobs of Wexford. Nearly
seven thousand birds were counted there during the autumn of 1976. The
Slobs is a large area of reclaimed marshland at the mouth of the River
Slaney covering about 2500 hectares. At one time it was all used as pastureland
and on it lay pools of water which geese love. Most of the Slobs is now
used for growing grain, but there is still enough grassland remaining to
provide for thousands of wintering geese. The area is well worth a visit
in winter; as in addition to the geese, many other kinds of wildfowl can
be seen feeding here. Small parties of pink-footed geese visit Ireland
during the winter and are usually found among the other parties of geese.
Wexford is the most likely place to see them. Like Greylags they have pink
legs, but they are smaller than Greylags and have a dark head and neck.
These birds nest in Iceland.</font></b>
