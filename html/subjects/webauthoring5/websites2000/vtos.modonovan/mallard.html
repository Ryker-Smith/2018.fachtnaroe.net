<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The mallard is the commonest waterfowl living
throughout the year in Ireland. You will have seen it on many different
types of water throughout the country. Simi-tame birds can be seen in city
parks, on canals and on ponds and they will feed readily from your hand.
One of the reasons the mallard has become so successful is because it has
adapted to living alongside man. It doesn’t mind disturbance such as the
noise from busy roads or people walking close by.. As long as it is not
persecuted directly, it will survive quiet happily. Mallard are a fairly
large duck. The drake in his breeding plumage has a glossy green head,
a white collar ring, chestnut breast, a grey belly and a grey and black
back and wings. The bill is a yellowish-green and the legs are orange.
The duck is much duller: she is a uniform brown colour with paler marks
on her head. During the winter the drake loses his bright colours and becomes
very much like the female.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; Mallard usually build their nest on the
ground amongst thick undergrowth such as grass, nettles, brambles or bracken.
They prefer islands in lakes to the shore. In built up areas they have
been known to nest in some very odd places such as roof gardens, flower
boxes and water towers. Nesting begins n March with usually ten to twelve
greyish-green eggs laid. The first eggs hatch in about the middle of April,
and from then until July the ducklings can be seen. The eggs and young
birds are cared for entirely be the female bird. The drake abandons her
shortly after she has begun to brood, and he goes off to join other drakes
in moulting. Unlike swans and geese, mallard and dabbling ducks in general
do not mate for life but take a new mate each year. During the shooting
season, from 1st September to 31st January, mallard are a favourite target
for wildfowlers and many are shot during this period. So as to be sure
to have plenty of birds to shoot, gun clubs often breed mallard by hand
in pens and release them when they are well grown. About 11,000 of these
birds have been reared in Ireland since 1965.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp; You may be lucky enough to find
one of these hand-reared birds, dead or alive, with a ring on its leg.
If you do, you should return it to the address written on it and you will
receive a letter telling you where and when it was ringed. Hand-reared
mallard do not travel very far from their birthplace, but great numbers
of them come in for Britain each winter. We also get birds here from the
Continent. The race of mallard found in Ireland is known as the green-headed
mallard. Mallard have been reared and domesticated for thousands of years.
They were tamed by man earlier than any other bird and are the ancestors
of the domestic ducks seen on farms around the country.</font>
