<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF">Wildfowl is the
common name given to the swans, geese and ducks. They are also known by
the scientific name Anatilae. This web-site deals with wildfowl found in
Ireland, those which stay all year and those which only visit us for the
winter.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF">All wildfowl are
adapted to living on or near water. They have webbed feet for swimming
and a broad bill for straining out food from the water. They moult or loose
their feathers usually once a year in late summer. For one or two months
until their new plumage grows, they cannot fly. In swans and geese the
male and female look exactly the same. Male ducks, however, have a breeding
plumage which is brighter and much more colourful than that of females
or immature birds. Geese are found only in the Northern Hemisphere. The
vast majority of them migrate between breeding grounds in the far north
and the wintering grounds further south.</font></font></b>

Ireland is a particularly good area for wildfowl as it is cool enough for
some species to breed and mild enough in winter to attract visiting birds.
In Ireland, unlike some other European countries, still has many undisturbed
wetlands areas favourable to wildfowl. The Wexford Slobs, Rahasane Turlough,
Lough Neagh, the Bull Island and the Shannon Basin are the Irish wildfowl
haunts of international importance. Today, many of our wetlands are under
threat of drainage as efforts are made to improve and extend farming land.
One way to avoid this is by teaching people to appreciate the value and
beauty of wildfowl. Maybe this book will help you to learn something about
Irish wildfowl so that you can help to preserve them and their habitats
for all to enjoy.</font></font></b>
