<p><font color="#000000">Bob Marley was a hero figure, in the classic mythological
sense. His departure from this planet came at a point when his vision of
One World, One Love inspired by his belief in Rastafari was beginning to
be heard and felt. The last Bob Marley and the Wailers tour in 1980 attracted
the largest audiences at that time for any musical act in Europe. And his
audience continues, in the Third World his impact goes much further. Not
just among Jamaicans, but also the Hopi Indians of New Mexico and the Maoris
of New Zealand. In Indonesia and India and especially in those parts of
West Africa from which slaves were plucked and taken to the New World.
Bob is seen as a redeemer figure.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Born Robert Nesta Marley on February 6, 1945 in
Nine Miles, (St.Ann) Jamaica, Bob was destined for superstardom. His father
Norval Sinclair Marley was an English marine-officer and his mother Cedella
‘Ciddy’ Malcom was a native Jamaican who lived in Rhoden Hall. After Bob
was born, his father left his mother. A couple of years later Bob and his
mother moved to Trench Town (West-Kingston) because his mother was looking
for a job. Bob loved the fast life in the big city and it was here he got
his nickname Tuff Gong. It was because of his ability to talk his way out
of trouble with the local bullies. Bob spent his best years in Trenchtown,
a government-housing scheme in West Kingston. It was in Trenchtown where
Bob was first exposed to Rastafari.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Bob spent most of his time with his friend Bunny
Livingston. They often went together to Joe Higgs’s (a famous singer in
Kingston) music class, and it was there that they met Peter McIntosh. In
1962 Bob auditioned for Leslie Kong, who took the young singer into the
studio to record his first single “Judge Not”. The following year Bob formed
the Wailing Wailers together with Peter and Bunny. They were introduced
to Clement Dodd, a producer of the record company Coxsone. On this label
the Wailing Wailers released their first single, "Simmer Down”, which created
a big sensation in Jamaica. By this time three more members had joined
the group: Junior Braithwaite, Beverly Kelso and Cherry Smith. The Wailing
Wailers began recording regularly and released some music that established
the group in Jamaica. When Junior, Beverly and Cherry left the Wailers
were back to the original trio.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Around that time, Bob joined his mother in the
United States, but just before he left he married Rita Anderson. In America
he worked just enough to be able to finance his music and then he returned
to Jamaica. When Bob came back, he, Bunny and Peter reformed the group
as the Wailers. And when they met Lee Perry, the group got back on their
feet again. Lee Perry and the Wailers produced great tracks like “Soul
Rebel”, “Duppy Conqueror”, “400 years” and “Small Axe”.</font></center>

<p>The Wailers had now access to great recording facilities and for the
first time, a reggae group could compete with the already established rock
groups. The album was called “Catch a Fire” and was released in1972. In
1973 the Wailers came to London and started a three month tour in Britain.
After that they returned to Jamaica and Bunny decided not to go on tour
with the Wailers again. Joe Higgs replaced him. Their second album “Burning”
was released in 1973. That included songs like “Get Up Stand Up” and “I
Shot The Sheriff”. In the beginning of 1975 the group released the “Natty
Dread” album that contained “Talking Blues”, “No Woman No Cry” and “Revolution”.
During that time Peter left the band to go solo. The band was renamed “Bob
Marley and the Wailers”. When the band performed at the Lyceum the show
was recorded and later released as “Live”.“Rastaman Vibration” was released
in 1976 and soared into the charts in England and the United States. “Rat
Race”, “Johnny Was” and “War” are a few tracks that made the album so popular.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Bob Marley decided to hold a free concert in Kingston on December 5
1976. The idea was to work for peace among the warring factions in Jamaica.
The government called an election about two weeks before the concert and
that was a signal for renewed ghetto war. Gunmen broke into Bob’s house
on the eve of the concert and shot Bob, Rita and some of their friends.
But they were lucky. Nobody got killed most of the wounds could have been
fatal. Bob eventually decided to go on with the show, and it was a show
to remember. In 1977 the whole group moved to London to record and later
release the album “Exodus”. It went to number one in England and Germany
and the singles “Exodus”, “Waiting in Vain” and “Jammin” sold in massive
numbers. The band toured Europe and at the beginning of the tour Bob hurt
a toe during a football game and was later on diagnosed with cancer. In
1978 Bob Marley and the Wailers released “Kaya”. Two singles went into
the charts: “Satisfy my Soul” and “Is This Love”.
