<P>Bunny Wailer teamed with Peter Tosh and Bob Marley to form the Wailers
in 1964. Marleys closest friend, Bunny Wailer is the only surviving Wailer.
Born Neville Livingston, he attended the same school as Bob in nine miles,
and the two boys became close friends. The two boys were separated when
Bunny’s family moved to Kingston. When Bob was brought to Kingston by his
mother, Bunny was there to greet him. Early in 1967, Bunny was arrested
for marijuana possession. Despite the fact that the officers found no weed
on him, he was convicted on the testimony of the arresting officer. Bunny
served one year and two months, and was released in September 1968. Bunny
refused to travel on an “iron bird” to tour the United States, but agreed
to a tour of England. When thick snow blanketed the ground at the Northampton
venue, Bunny and Peter quit the tour and flew back to Jamaica. Bob and
Bunny continued to maintain a good relationship. Bunny simply wasn’t prepared
to make the sacrifices that life on the road as a new group entails. Bunny
left the Wailers in 1974. Today Bunny resides in Kingston and on a farm
in the interior of Jamaica.
