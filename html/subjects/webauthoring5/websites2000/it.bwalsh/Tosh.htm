<P>Peter Tosh met Bob Marley in Trenchtown, and became one of the three
original Wailers. A strong-willed man, Tosh left the Wailers in 1974 after
Chris Blackwell refused to issue his first solo album. Peter Tosh was an
extremely talented man, but at he same time he was very bitter. He was
in many ways just like Bob Marley. What bound them together more than anything
was that they both naturally rebelled against the “shit-stem”. Tosh was
no stranger to tragedy. In 1973 he wrote of hie car on the Spanish Town
Bridge. His girlfriend at the time was killed and Tosh himself suffered
severe head injuries.Yet his accusation that Bob’s success was only because
he had white blood was inexcusable. Peter Tosh came to a tragic end in
September 1987, he was gunned down in a robbery at his home by an old acquaintance.
