<p>On June 15, Bob received the Third World Peace Medal by all the African
delegations at the United Nations. Bob also went to Africa that year and
went to Kenya and Ethiopia. The earlier tour in Europe was recorded as
the basis for the bands second live album “Babylon By Bus”. In 1979 “Survival”
was released and it included such tracks as “Zimbabwe”, “So Much Trouble
In The World”, “Ambush In The Night” and “Africa Unite”. In the beginning
of 1980 Bob Marley and the Wailers flew to Gabon to make their African
debut. It was there that Bob found out that Don Taylor (Bob’s manager)
had defrauded him. The government of Zimbabwe invited the group to play
at the country’s Independence Ceremony in April of that year. The bands
last album “Uprising” featured songs like “Could You Be Loved”, “Coming
In From The Cold”, “Work” and the impressive ballad “Redemption Songs”.
<p>The group went on a European tour, which included a concert in Milan
with over one hundred thousand people. The new album did well and plans
were made for an American tour. Bob started at Madison Square Garden and
continued to the Stanley Theatre in Pittsburgh, which would be his last
performance. At this point the cancer had spread throughout his boy to
the stomach, lungs and unfortunately even to the head. On his way to Jamaica,
Bob died in a Miami hospital May 11 1981. He was 36 years old.
<p>Bob Marleys funeral in Jamaica on 21 May 1981 was one fit for a King.
Hundreds of thousands of people (including the Prime Minister) visited
the funeral. After which Bob’s body was taken to his birthplace were it
rests in a mausoleum. Today it is a place of pilgrimage. In 1983 the Confrontation
album was released. The song Buffalo Soldier became a famous hit. In 1984
Legend was released. Thanks to the hit One Love/People Get Ready this beautiful
album became a worldwide bestseller. Bob Marley and the Wailers were ‘back
to live’.
