<font color="#FF0000">2.]</font>&nbsp; Arsenal quietened
down in the nineteen sixties. They had no success what so ever. The find
glory again in 1971 when they won their league and domestic cup, they beat
Manchester United 3-2 in extra time. Arsenal limelight was taken away,
they were not the run away cup winners like they were in previous years.
They didn't stop winning trophies they just didn't win as much as they
did. The likes of <a href="http://www.liverpoolfootballclub.com">Liverpool</a>
and Nottingham Forest were winning everything. In Arsenals career they
have not been relegated from the top division in 87 years from 1913 to
the Present day.
<p>Arsenal proved once again that they Arsenal says never give and that
motto was proven right they won the league the following year. They won
it in typical Arsenal style they won it with class. Its ironic Arsenal
had a pretty bad season all year round they were deducted 2 points for
having a brawl for all on the pitch at Old Trafford (Manchester United
home ground). Tony Adams the Arsenal captain was arrested for drink driving
and was sent to prison for 4 months a week before Christmas which was a
blow to Arsenal because that the time of the year when Arsenal play badly.
Arsenal were eliminated from the Champions league in the two seasons in
which they participated in. They were eliminated in the first round of
the tournament. They finished Twice in third place.
<p>Even though Arsene Wenger has did allot for Arsenal But the disciplinary
record at Arsenal is disgraceful. 28 players have been sent off the pitch
since Arsene arrived in the summer of the season of 97/98. That is a major
disapointment. Another disapointment was in the space of 6 years Arsenal
had three different managers George Graham from 1986-1994, Bruce Rioch
from 1995-1996,Stewert Houston from late 1996-1997( Stewert Houstan was
only a caretaker manager a temporary manager until they could presently
fill the post. The current manager is Arsene Wenger.
