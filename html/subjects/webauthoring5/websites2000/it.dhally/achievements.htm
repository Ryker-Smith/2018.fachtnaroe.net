<font color="#FF0000">1.]&nbsp;</font> In the season of 1987\1988
Arsenal won the Milk Cup. They're first success in years. Things were looking
For George and his team. They finished second only to Liverpool in the
league of 1988\1989. The following season though Arsenal got some revenge
on their arch rivals Liverpool; Arsenal won the league on goal difference.
Michael Thomas scored in the last minute of the match. It was a glorious
kick in the teeth to Liverpool who thought they were unbeatable.
<p>The following season Arsenal went further in their ventures they <a href="http://www.Arsenalfootballclub.com">Arsenal</a>
got into the Cup Winners Cup (Now an abolished tournament)
<br>they went through every team they came across in the tournament. They
beat Parma an Italian club to win the cup. When they won it they went on
to play in the tournament again the following season. If they won this
cup again they would have gone down in history as the only club to win
the Cup Winners Cup two years in a row. They almost did this they got to
the finals, they played a Spanish side called Real Zaragoza. It would have
gone into extra -time but in the last minute a fifty yard effort by a player
called Nihau scored, David Seaman got his fingers to the ball, but it wasn't
enough.
<p>Arsenal in the 1997\1998 season won the Premiership league for the first
time since this new division was set up in 1992. This also granted Arsenal
to play in the Champions League (previously know as the European Cup) but
the Champions League was a big flop for Arsenal. The following season Arsenal
finished second to Manchester United only by one point because Nelson Vivas
let the team down by making a stupid mistake by not keeping his eye on
the ball letting a Leeds United player getting the opportunity to get the
goal and the victory. That defeat caused Arsenal caused Arsenal the league
title.
<p>In Arsenal long history they have won their league title 12 times, they
won the <a href="http://www.UEFACUP.com">UEFA CUP</a> 1, they won the Cup
Winners Cup 1 and they won their domestic cup 7 times.
