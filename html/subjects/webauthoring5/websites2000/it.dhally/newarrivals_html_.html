<font color="#FF0000">3.]&nbsp;</font> In 1984 saw the arrival
of one of the most distinguished defenders in English football now Tony
Adams fresh out of Arsenals youth team. He made his mark. This was the
beginning of Arsenal legendary defense. In late 1986 a great thing happened
to Arsenal the introduction of George Graham a manager who they needed
to bring back the spark of success to the club. It only took him a year
to win some silverware. In his first year at the club he almost won Arsenal
a trophy but it wasn't to be in the final of the Littlewoods Cup Arsenal
took a suprise defeat by the hands of Luton Town a team now in the second
division (used to be the old third division) 2
<p>Graham need to change a few things to win trophies for the club. He
bought Alan Smith from Leicester City. This man was a striker he was one
of most talented strikers of his time. He also bought a few more players
of different positions the likes of Nigel Winterburn and Lee Dixon made
of the defense alongside Tony Adams and Steve Bould (now with Sunderland).
Also Michael Thomas made it to the first team. The manager didn't change
one factor he still kept David O’Leary a man who has been with the club
at the time he has been with them over 15 years.
<p>It was a glorious thing to happen to Arsenal when they bought David
Seaman from Queens Park Rangers for only 1.5million pounds. David proved
to be an asset to the club on a numerous occasions not only for club but
also for his country to. A major blow happened to Arsenal the following
season instead of winning the league they only finished 4th position, which
was pretty bad that for topside. Of course it was great for Liverpool because
not only did they win the league they also got one over Arsenal.
<p>In 1995 saw the arrival of two of the most talented soccer players in
the world Dennis Berckamp and Mark Overmars. They were both purchased from
Ajax a Dutch side. Dennis Berckamp was bought for 7.5 million pounds. Mark
was bought for 5 million. They have been the talent behind Arsenal goal
scorings for a long time now. Mark Overmars supplying the balls in and
Dennis scoring. Another foreign players were bought into the club they
were two French players Emmanual Petite, Gills Grimandi and Patrick Viera.
Two of these outstanding players play in midfield and the other plays at
the back but he isn't a regular he mainly is a reserve player, still he
is a vital player when he's needed. Emmanual and patrick have their bad
sides their disciplinary record has been disgraceful. Since their arrival
to the club Emmanual has been sent of 4 times and Patrick 5 times. But
some times they didn't deserve to be sent off. Emmanual has threatened
to leave the club because he thinks he been treated unfairly sice he came
here.
