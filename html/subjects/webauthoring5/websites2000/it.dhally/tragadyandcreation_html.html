Arsenal spectacular history began in the year of 1886. They were first
called Royal Arsenal and they changed that name almost a year later. Only
four years into their footballing career they won their first trophies.
After their success in the league Arsenal changed their football ground
to Manor Field. In later years Arsenal changed their football ground to
Highbury in North London. They currently are still at Highbury.
<p>A great tragic ordeal occurred in 1939 at the start of World war 2 when
Arsenals football stadium was heavily bombed by the Germans which claimed
the lives of 10 of the 50 professional players that Arsenal had. That was
the highest loss to have happened to any club at the time. Only a more
tragic accident to occur was to Manchester United in the late nineteen
fifties and the most of the of all the incident of 1989 in Hillsborough
when the top of the stadium collapsed when hundreds of people started to
get out of control and caused the stadium to collapse under the pressure.
The result was that the death of hundreds of people, and left more people
injured.
