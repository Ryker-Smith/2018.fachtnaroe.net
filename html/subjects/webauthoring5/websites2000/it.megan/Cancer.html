<center><b><font size=+1>What is cancer?</font></b></center>

<p>Our bodies are made up of millions of building blocks called cells.&nbsp;
Cancer occurs when one or more of the cells break free from the normal
restraint it is under and starts to multiply in an abnormal, uncontrolled
way.&nbsp; This can happen to more or less any type of cell: bone, skin,
blood, glands, muscle etc. so there are as many types of cancers as there
are different cells in the body - about 200!&nbsp; Unfortunately all these
diseases have different causes, different symptoms and often respond differently
to treatment.&nbsp; Different cancers affect people at different ages,
but the risk of getting the disease rises rapidly as we get older - over
65.<font size=+1></font>

<p><b><font size=+1>What causes cancer?</font></b></center>
<font size=+1></font>
<p>In cancer, cells go wrong as a result of faults in their genes, which
means that there are mistakes in the cell's instructions.&nbsp; Genetic
faults can either be inherited from our parents, or more often they are
the result of damage by cancer causing agents such as tobacco, viruses,
sunlight or dietary factors that we encounter from day to day.&nbsp; It
takes more than one fault to turn a cell into a cancer cell, but as we
go through life we tent to accumulate these genetic mistakes.&nbsp; Cancer-causing
agents that damage genes are known as carcinogens.

<p><b><font size=+1>How do cancers develop?</font></b></center>
<font size=+1></font>
<p>Healthy cells divide and increase in number as we grow or as the body
repairs itself.&nbsp; When enough cells have been produced for a particular
purpose this dividing mechanism switches off naturally.&nbsp; In cancer
cells, the dividing process goes out of control because the genetic instructions
are faulty.&nbsp; As a result, cancer cells divide when it is not necessary
and then continue to increase in number, forming a mass of abnormal cells.&nbsp;
These cells don’t work properly as part of the organ or tissue where they
began.&nbsp; They become interested only in reproducing themselves, and
are unable to know when to stop.&nbsp; Normal cells often have a limited
life span.&nbsp; They are pre-programmed to die when they are too old or
if they start malfunctioning.&nbsp; Cancer cells override this pre-programming
and become immortal.&nbsp; As the cells multiply, the mass of cells or
tumour takes up more and more room.&nbsp; It may invade nearby parts of
the body and prevent them from working properly.&nbsp; Not all tumours
are cancers.&nbsp; If the tumour is enclosed and does not spread it is
called a benign tumour, which is usually harmless.&nbsp; If the tumour
spreads into the normal tissue surrounding it or further, it is called
a malignant tumour or cancer.

<blockquote>> Benign tumours:
<br>> are not cancerous
<br>> can usually be removed
<br>> do not come back in most cases
<br>> do not spread to other parts of the body and the cells do not invade
other tissues
<p>&nbsp;
<br>> Malignant tumours:
<br>> are cancerous
<br>> can invade and damage nearby tissues and organs
<br>> metastasise (cancer cells break away from a malignant tumour and
enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system to form secondary tumours in
other parts of the body)</blockquote>

<p><br><b><font size=+1>How do cancers spread?</font></b></center>
&nbsp;
<br>Cancers are not infections and do not spread from person to person.&nbsp;
However, once they advance beyond a certain point, they become able to
spread within a person.&nbsp; A tumour that has the potential to spread
is malignant because it has more serious implications for the patient.&nbsp;
Cancers spread by invading the surrounding tissue until they reach a blood
or lymph vessel.&nbsp; Small groups of cells may then break off from the
original tumour (primary tumour).&nbsp; These are then carried via the
bloodstream to other parts of the body, where they may settle and grow.&nbsp;
This process is called metastasising.&nbsp; The new cancers that develop
are known as secondary cancers.
