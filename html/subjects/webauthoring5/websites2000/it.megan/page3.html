<p><b><u><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=+2>How do cancers
develop?</font></font></u></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">Healthy cells divide and increase in
number as we grow or as the body repairs itself.&nbsp; When enough cells
have been produced for a particular purpose this dividing mechanism switches
off naturally.&nbsp; In cancer cells, the dividing process goes out of
control because the genetic instructions are faulty.&nbsp; As a result,
cancer cells divide when it is not necessary and then continue to increase
in number, forming a mass of abnormal cells.&nbsp; These cells don’t work
properly as part of the organ or tissue where they began.&nbsp; They become
interested only in reproducing themselves, and are unable to know when
to stop.&nbsp; Normal cells often have a limited life span.&nbsp; They
are pre-programmed to die when they are too old or if they start malfunctioning.&nbsp;
Cancer cells override this pre-programming and become immortal.&nbsp; As
the cells multiply, the mass of cells or tumour takes up more and more
room.&nbsp; It may invade nearby parts of the body and prevent them from
working properly.&nbsp; Not all tumours are cancers.&nbsp; If the tumour
is enclosed and does not spread it is called a benign tumour, which is
usually harmless.&nbsp; If the tumour spreads into the normal tissue surrounding
it or further, it is called a malignant tumour or cancer.</font>
