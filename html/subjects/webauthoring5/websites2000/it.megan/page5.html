<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">The three main types of treatment for
cancer are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&nbsp; If someone has
been diagnosed with cancer, the treatment that they would receive would
depend on the type of cancer and whether it had spread.&nbsp; Sometimes
people are given a combination of two or more types of treatment.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><u><font face="Courier New,Courier">Surgery</font></u>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">This is an operation to remove the
cancer.&nbsp; Surgery is often combined with other types of treatment to
make sure all the cancer cells are killed.</font>
<p><u><font face="Courier New,Courier">Radiotherapy</font></u>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">This means using specialised machines
to direct beams of radiation at the area of the body where the cancer cells
are.&nbsp; The radiation kills or inactivates the cancer cells so they
stop dividing and the tumour stops growing.&nbsp; Sometimes radiotherapy
is used to shrink the tumour so that it is easier to remove by surgery.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">External: Beam that is directed at
an angle to penetrate the affected area but reduce the amount of exposure
to any one area of the skin.</font>
<br><font face="Courier New,Courier">>&nbsp; Marks on skin to ensure the
patient is positioned properly for each treatment.</font>
<br><font face="Courier New,Courier">> Actual treatment lasts for 2 - 5
minutes.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">Internal: Implantation - radioisotope
in a metal case cover e.g. needles, seeds, planted in a cavity or implanted
in tissue during an operation.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><u><font face="Courier New,Courier">Chemotherapy</font></u>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">This means treating the cancer cells
with drugs that are designed to kill them.&nbsp; The drugs are carried
around in the bloodstream and so can reach different areas in the body
at the same time.&nbsp; For instance, it is an effective treatment for
leukaemia, cancer of the blood cells, where the disease is present through
the body.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">Chemotherapy may offer a cure, provide
long term control and improved survival and palliation.&nbsp; It may be
used as a primary form of treatment or in combination with surgery or radiation,
this is known as adjutant chemotherapy.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">Palliative chemotherapy: This may be
used as treatment for people whose cancer cannot be controlled or cured
but where it would be of benefit to the person to control pain and other
distressing symptoms.</font>
