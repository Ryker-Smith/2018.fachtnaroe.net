<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But like most electrical appliances the
chair doesn’t always run smoothly. In July 1999, Allen Lee Davis was executed
in Florida. He was hit with 2300 volts and blood started to pour from his
mouth. The electrocution continued and by the time he was pronounced dead
the stain that had fallen from his mouth was the size of a dinner plate
on his shirt and had seeped through the straps. He was the first on the
Florida’s new electric chair.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In March 1997, also in Florida, during
the execution of Pedro Medina blue and orange flames sparked from the mask
covering his face. Flames up to a foot long shot out from the right side
of his head for up to 10 seconds. The execution chamber clouded with smoke,
and the smell filled the witness room.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">July 14 1989, Alabama. Horace F. Dunkins
who was mentally retarded took 19 minutes to be executed. Due to human
error – faulty cable hookups, there wasn’t enough current to cause death.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is also unknown if the victims feel
pain. A few who have survived the chair say that the pain is unbearable.
Others say when the chair operates properly the victim’s nerves are immediately
paralysed stopping all sensation of pain.</font>
