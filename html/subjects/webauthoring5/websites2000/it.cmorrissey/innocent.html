<center><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>SLAUGHTER OF THE
INNOCENT</font></font></i></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Even though the United States are seen
as the leaders of the world in every aspect they still appear to be in
the Middle Age when it comes to dealing with their criminals. Since 1890
the electric chair has been used to execute criminals.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ever since then there has been a wave of
controversy in the United States. Indeed it is a grisly end but what most
protestors are trying to prove is that there is too much room for error
and innocent people can be executed, also another issue that has arose
is that race plays a factor when the punishment is being decided.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Since 1973, a total of 69 people have been
released from Death Row after their innocence had been proven or there
proved to be not enough evidence that would have saved them from conviction.
This is a number out of 6,000 been convicted. Which works out at 1 out
of every 100. These statistics prove that the legal system in the United
States has its flaws and has made mistakes known and unknown in the past
and will undoubtedly continue to do so.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are many causes to why an innocent
person could be tried and found guilty of a crime. Crimes of a chilling
nature, i.e. child murders, elderly people being raped, family murders,
serial killers and serial rapists all receive attention in the media and
public rage along with demands for arrests put severe pressure on the police.
The police don’t have an easy job and along with the dangers that their
jobs come with they don’t need the added pressure from an angry public.
The detectives don’t do it consciously but as soon as they see any sign
of potential guilt they will try and establish that the person is guilty.
This establishment can also be helped by unreliable witnesses and even
the actual offender themselves may help to frame and give false testimony
in the court of law.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The added publicity to the cases also can
influence the jury. If it is a notorious crime then it will have received
a lot of publicity from the media, and before a juror may even heard any
evidence in the court they may already have formed a verdict in their own
mind, without being rational and listening to the evidence being presented.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The above are all factors contributing
to whites and blacks being convicted. But black people have more than that
to go against them. It has been proven that a black person is eleven times
more likely to be convicted of killing a white person that a white person
being convicted for killing a black person. About 84% of the victims in
death penalty cases are white, even though only 50% of overall murder cases
are the victims white.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">‘In 82% of the studies reviewed, race of
the victim was found to influence the likelihood of being charged with
capital murder or receiving the death penalty, i.e., those who murdered
whites were more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murdered
blacks.’</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">- U.S General Accounting Office, Death
Penalty Sentencing, Feb 1990.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The fact that there has been a number
of people freed from death row make one think that the legal system does
recognise its errors and releases the innocent before they are executed.
But this isn’t always the case.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Advances in DNA have established many innocent
prisoners’ innocence. In the recent case of Rolando Cruz, Alejandro Hernandez,
Vernal Jimerson and Dennis Williams advanced DNA testing ensured their
release. They were evidence prior to this though that they were innocent
because another man had confessed to the crime and the evidence against
them wasn’t very substantial. Now the four men are free and three former
prosecutors and four police officers have been indicted for obstruction
of justice in this case.&nbsp; If their appeals had run out four or five
years after their convictions, they would be dead today.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Jonathan Treadway in Arizona 1975 was freed
thanks to medical science. He had been convicted for the murder and rape
of a six year old girl and sentenced to death. At a retrial five pathologists
testified that the victim probably died of natural causes and there was
no evidence of sodomy.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another victim of police mispractice was
Jerry Banks of Georgia. He was released in 1975 after been sentenced to
death for two counts of murder. The conviction was later quashed because
it came out that the prosecution had withheld evidence that proved their
innocence. But this action had further consequences. As a result Mr. Banks
committed suicide following his divorce. His estate sued the state and
won benefits for his children.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That same year in Louisiana, Johnny Ross
was released when his blood type was found to be inconsistent with that
of the rapist’s.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It took more than two trials before Kirk
Bloodsworth’s innocence was proven in Maryland 1984. He had been convicted
and sentenced for the rape and murder of a young girl. He was later granted
a new trial and got a life sentence instead of execution. But his innocence
was later proven when DNA testing confirmed his innocence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Gregory R. Wilhoit wasn’t acquitted until
1993 at a retrial. In 1987 he had been convicted of killing his estranged
wife. In 1991 he was released when 11 forensic experts testified that a
bite mark found on the victim did not belong to him. The appeals court
also found ineffective assistance of counsel. It had taken seven years.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But expert and medical testimony hasn’t
always been beneficiary to defendants, Anthony Ray Peek was released in
1978 after was proven to be false.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1974, Joseph Green Brown of Florida
was released 13 hours before his execution. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the prosecution had a knowingly allowed false testimony to be
introduced into the trial.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Patrick Croy’s conviction in California
1979 was quashed because of improper jury instructions. His argument was
changed to self - defence at the retrial.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Again in Florida 1980, Earnest Miller freed
because he hadn’t been allowed introduce evidence that would have proven
his innocence during trial. He was later awarded compensation from the
Pasco County Sheriff’s Department because of official errors.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That same year Clarence Brandley was released
in Texas. He too hadn’t been allowed produce evidence that would have proven
his innocence, there was also perjury by prosecution witnesses.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Also that same year in Georgia, Gary Nelson
was released after it was established that the prosecutor’s had withheld
evidence from the defence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1988, Walter McMillan of Alabama was
freed following three witnesses withdrawing their evidence and prosecutors
agreeing that the case had been mishandled.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Even though the media puts pressure on
the police and jurors to make a conviction they often are responsible for
having innocent prisoners released. ‘The Thin Blue Line’ was based on the
convicted killer on death row Randall Dale Adams. During the initial documentary
by Errol Morris the real killer confessed to his crime. This documentary
resulted in the film and the release of Adams.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the same state – Texas, Clarence Bradley
had been convicted of murder and rape in a racially charged case. Civil
rights groups took an interest in his case and tried to prove his innocence.
Due to this publicity the American television show – ’60 Minutes’ made
a documentary about Bradley. He was later released. These two men were
lucky, because not all death row innocents have media attention or finance
to get them back into the appeals courts.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is evident that there is a growing rise
in the number of wrongful murder convictions with a sentence of execution.
In contrast the opportunity to appeal and to produce new evidence proving
evidence has decreased. The government funding for the death penalty resource
centres that help prove innocence and provide financial aid has been withdrawn.
Some courts now believe it is acceptable to go ahead and hand out the death
penalty when there is reasonable doubt to the guilt of a defendant.</font>
