<blockquote><b><font size=+2>Introduction</font></b>
<p>This website will concentrate on the preparaion of the ceiling and walls
of a room that are to be finished with paint.&nbsp; To be successful in
your decorating you must prepare the surface properly first.&nbsp; Although
there are many aspects in decorating a room such as color scheme, paint
or wallpaper, curtains, pictures, flooring and lighting.&nbsp; For this
project I will explain in detail how to prepare walls and the ceiling.&nbsp;
Even before you decide on colors or wallcoverings the preparation of all
surfaces must be done properly.&nbsp; It does not matter how much money
you spend on wallpaper or special paints,&nbsp; if the preparation is not
done properly the finish will not look good.
<p>It is important to have the right tools for the right job.&nbsp; The
main tools used in the preparation of a room are scrapers, filling knives,
sandpaper, steam strippers, and blow torches.&nbsp; I will give a description
of all these tools and the correct way in which to use them.
<p>Once all the preparation has been done I will explain how to put the
finishing coats to all surfaces.&nbsp; There is a wrong and a right way
to paint walls and ceilings.&nbsp; Anyone can paint a wall or ceiling but
not everyone can do a good job of it.
<p>As in the preparation it is also important to have the right tools for
the finishing off.&nbsp; The main tools for this part of the job are brushes
and rollers.&nbsp; Brushes come in a variety of sizes and shapes which
I will go into detail about.
<p>When the walls and ceilings have been finished next the woodwork must
be finished.&nbsp; Woodwork and metalwork also have a wrong and a right
way of being painted.
<p>I will also explain how to tackle most of the problems that people come
across when decorating.&nbsp; There are a wide variety of things that can
go wrong and I will give advice on the best solution to the most common
problems.
<p>So to sum up I will demonstrate how to prepare and decorate the ceiling
and walls of&nbsp; a room from start to finish.&nbsp; I will explain what
equipment is required and how to use the equipment for the job.&nbsp; The
most important part of decorating is the preparation of the surfaces.&nbsp;
The secret to a good finish is good preparation.&nbsp; Most of the hard
work and most of the time goes into the preparation of the surfaces.</blockquote>
