<p><font color="#FFFFFF">All of those clubs had a worse record than spurs---except
on the points!</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">To the surprise of many, Tottenham failed to
win another trophy for 30 years, going through five managers and being
relegated twice before a new era began at White Hart Lane in 1950.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">It took five seasons and three managers to get
us back upstairs! The 1928-29 and 1929-30 seasons saw a much-overdue rebuilding
period. All looked well for returning to the top in 1930-31 until Eddie
Harper, our leading goal-scorer, broke a leg at a crucial part of the season
and we fell away to finish 3rd. The following season, we never even appeared
to figure in the promotion race; but in</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">1932-33 promotion finally came---despite a terrible
start! The miserable beginning of the season started rumours that spurs
could be relegated to the Third Division (South), but a long, undefeated
run combined with crucial losses by our rivals led to a promotion in 1933-34.
It was a good season, and at one point the Championship might have been
in sight; but a 3rd place finish was all we could</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">muster. The following season---well, we were
bloody awful, and were relegated long before the end of the season.</font>
