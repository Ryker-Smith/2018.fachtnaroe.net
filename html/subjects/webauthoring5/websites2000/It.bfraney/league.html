<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1908 Tottenham applied to get in to the Football
league but it was rejected until Stoke city dropped</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Out of the league.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Spurs won promotion to the First Division at
the first attempt but struggled in the six seasons.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">We were in the top flight, finally finishing
at the bottom by the end of the 1914-15 season. After narrowly avoiding
the drop three-times.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1915-16 season took the Second division with
a total of 70 points they were back in top flight in the First division.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Back in Division One, spurs took some time to
settle and finished sixth. By then we were a much more powerful force,
with the drive of left-half and captain Arthur Grimsdell; and the craft
of Jimmy Seed, Jimmy Cantrell and Jimmy Dimmock. They were the backbone
of a team that gave our club a second F.A.Cup Final win, beating Wolves
1-0 on a rain-sodden pitch at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea. In</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">1921-22, Tottenham almost won the Double, finishing
runners-up to League Champions Liverpool, but losing to Preston in the
F.A.Cup semi-finals.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Thereafter, to the surprise of many, we fell
away until we were relegated at the end of 1927-28.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Before the Easter games, we were 7th with 35
points from 35 matches.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">However after accumulating only three more points
from our last seven matches, finishing our programme early and travelling
to Holland for a short tour, we returned to England only to find out that
we had been relegated---finishing immediately below six clubs all On 39
points!</font>
