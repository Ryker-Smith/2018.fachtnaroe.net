<br><u><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+2>Managers of Tottenham</font></font></u></center>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Then along came Arthur Rowe. Later, as manager,
Arthur was the mastermind of the famous "push and run" style which was
to bring our beloved club so much success. To play alongside Rowe, Willie
Hall was signed from Notts. County. A year later they both played in the
England team</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">which beat France 4-1 at White Hart Lane.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Rowe was forced however, to retire prematurely
because of injury. spurs the slipped disastrously out of the First after
only our second season back among the elite.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Fifteen years later, in 1949-50, Tottenham Hotspur
proudly regained their First Division status with stars such as: goalkeeper
Ted</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Ditchburn; full-back Alf Ramsey; wing-halves
Ronnie Burgess, Bill Nicholson and Eddie Baily ; centre-half Harry Clark;
and inside-forward Les Bennett. The man responsible for our change in fortune
was manager</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Arthur Rowe, whose famous "push and run" style
achieved promotion from the Second Division in 1950 at his first attempt.
Priding itself on its "flair," the team won admiration for not having a
single player sent off between 1928 and 1965.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Greater triumphs were to follow for our club.
Twelve months later we were League Champions. Gates at White Hart Lane
that season averaged over 55,000! In 1951-52, spurs, with manager Arthur
Rowe and his revolutionary "push and run" tactics were providing some</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">of the most exciting football of the age. But
the seeds of the second really great team were already being sown. Rowe’s
last act as a manager was to sign the great Danny Blanchflower from Aston
Villa---for peanuts!</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">The following season spurs finished second in
the league to Manchester United, which was no mean feat, but the "push
and run"</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">side was looking rather old and jaded. Rowe resigned
due to ill-health in 1955 and his successor, Jimmy Anderson slowly but
surely&nbsp; moulded the greatest team in spurs’ history. We claimed second
spot in 1956-57 and third place in 1957-58, largely due to the</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">creative combination of Tommy Harmer and Danny
Blanchflower with the goal-scoring prowess of Bobby Smith. Then Anderson
went</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">the same way as Rowe and retired due to ill-health.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Blanchflower was a very eloquent Irishman who
saw football as a game of chess. "We aim to equalise before the other team
score,"</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">was one epigram from the Irishman, although you
may have be familiar with other Blanchflower-isms. But Blanchflower’s genious
did</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">not flower until Bill Nicholson was appointed
manager</font>
