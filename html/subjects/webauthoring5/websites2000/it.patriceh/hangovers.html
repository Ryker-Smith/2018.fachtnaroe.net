<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>There are several things going
on that contribute to the intensity of a hangover, and some of these are
more controllable than others. The first (and most important) is the quantity
of alcohol consumed. The second is dehydration. Equally important, however,
is what you drink. There is an explainable scientific phenomenon that verifies
what you've suspected all this time:</font></font>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Vodka hangovers really do hurt
more than beer hangovers.</font></font>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Ethyl alcohol, or ethanol,
is the active ingredient in liquor.<img SRC="AG.gif" height=99 width=167 align=RIGHT>
It falls somewhere between a food and a drug in classification. A drug
is defined as anything that "is deemed to be for therapeutic or diagnostic
use or to affect the structure or function of the body." But ethanol is
a food in that, like proteins or fats, it has caloric value. This means
that as it's processed by your cells, ATP, the body's energy storage chemical,
is produced. Before this happens, however, ethanol must be transformed
into pyruvate, a normal product in sugar metabolism.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>The intermediate stage between
ethanol and pyruvate, acetaldehyde, is quite toxic and is the smoking gun
of the hangover phenomena. Like ethanol, acetaldehyde is processed by the
liver at a fixed rate, regardless of how much of it is in the bloodstream.
The conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde also uses excessive amounts of
NAD plus, an important element of the body's normal energy production process,
which explains some of the depressant effects of alcohol. The body's attempt
to restore normal levels of this element triggers a diuretic effect and
dehydration is the result. Not only do you get intermediate toxins, low
energy levels, and dehydration, but one side effect of dehydration is the
loss of needed water-soluble vitamins and minerals, generally wreaking
havoc on a body that's already been put through the wringer.</font></font><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1></font></font>
