<p><font face="Kids"><font color="#00CC00"><font size=+3>Alcohol </font></font></font><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>is
the term applied to members of a group of chemical compounds and, in popular
usage, to the specific compound ethyl alcohol, or ethanol. The Arabic word
denotes kohl, a fine powder of antimony used as an eye makeup. The word
alcohol originally denoted any fine powder; the alchemists of medieval
Europe later applied it to essences obtained by distillation, and this
led to the current usage.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Kids"><font color="#008080"><font size=+1>Classes of
alcohol:</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Alcohols are a class of organic
compounds containing the hydroxyl group, OH, attached to a carbon atom.
Alcohol’s have one, two, or three hydroxyl groups attached to their molecules
and are thus classified as monohydric, dihydric, or trihydric, respectively.
Methanol and ethanol are monohydric alcohols. Alcohols are further classified
as primary, secondary, or tertiary, according to whether one, two, or three
other carbon atoms are bound to the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group
is bound.&nbsp;<img SRC="vodka.gif" height=310 width=211 align=RIGHT>Alcohols,
although analogous to inorganic bases, are neither acid nor alkaline. They
are characterized by many common reactions, the most important of which
is the reaction with acids to form substances called esters, which are
analogous to inorganic salts. Alcohols are normal by-products of digestion
and chemical processes within cells and are found in the tissues and fluids
of animals and plants.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Kids"><font color="#00FF00"><font size=+1>Absorbtion
and distribution:</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>When an alcoholic beverage
is swallowed it is diluted by the stomach juices, and is very quickly distributed
throughout the body. Alcohol does not require digestion before its absorption
into the bloodstream. A small portion is diffused into the bloodstream
directly from the stomach wall.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Kids"><font color="#FF00FF"><font size=+1>Intoxication:</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>The drinking of small amounts
of alcohol, even if this is done regularly over a long period of time,
does not have any conclusively demonstrated pathological effect. A mild
infrequent intoxification produces a variety of temporary biochemical disturbances
in the body. But these changes leave no chronic after effects, and the
body rapidly returns to normal. A severe intoxication may produce more
serious disturbances, including a temporary imbalance of the body chemistry.</font></font>

<br><b><font face="Kids"><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>Effects of
alcohol</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Alcohol is also a mood altering
drug, which has both physical and mental effects on the body. The irritating
effects of alcohol, especially in undiluted strong beverages, can result
in damage to the tissues of the mouth, esophagus and stomach, perhaps with
increased susceptibility to cancer. The liver is likely to suffer serious
damage if it must cope lengthily with the detoxication of large amounts
of alcohol. There may also be damage to the heart muscle.</font></font>
