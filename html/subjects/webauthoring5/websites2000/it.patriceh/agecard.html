<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+3>Minister John O'Donoghue signs Age
Card Regulations</font></font>
<p><u><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Major initiative underway
to combat underage drinking</font></font></u></center>

<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>The Minister for Justice, Equality
and Law Reform, Mr. John O'Donoghue, T.D., today announced that he has
signed the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 (Age Card) Regulations, 1999.
The Regulations will come into operation in 3 months time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>The Regulations provide for
the first time a voluntary, national age card scheme which will greatly
strengthen the existing measures aimed at curbing the sale of alcohol to
persons under 18 years of age. When the Regulations come into operation
any person who has attained 18 years of age will be entitled to apply for
an age card at his or her local Garda Station. The application will be
accompanied by a birth certificate, at least one other document which confirms
the identity of the applicant, two photographs and the fee, which will
be &pound;5. If everything is in order the Garda&iacute; will authenticate
the identity and age of the applicant and forward what is necessary to
the Garda Community Relations Section where the card will be made.</font></font>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>The Minister said that the
card would only contain the information necessary for it to confirm the
holder's age; that is a photograph of the holder of the card along with
his or her name and date of birth. The Minister added that any security
measures necessary to prevent forging, tampering with or altering, would
also be a feature of the card.</font></font>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>The Minister went on to say
that he was satisfied that the introduction of a national age card would
make a significant contribution to the continuing fight against underage
drinking. He was confident that publicans, off-licence holders and others
who sold alcohol to the public would fully play their part in ensuring
the success of the scheme. In future there could be no excuse for selling
alcohol to those who were underage. This would be recognised in the intoxicating
liquor legislation which he intends to publish later this year; the defence
available to a licence holder to prove that he or she had reasonable grounds
for believing that a person was over 18 years of age will be abolished.</font></font>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Finally, the Minister paid
tribute to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, vintners and the many other
people who had organised, funded and operated voluntary identity card schemes
around the country for the past number of years. While they operated with
varying degrees of success, they lacked the level of consistency and use
of the most modern technology that will be a feature of the national scheme.</font></font>
