<p><b><u><font face="Kids"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+3>Alcoholism</font></font></font></u></b>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>The conception of drunkeness
as a disease appears to be rooted in antiquity. The Roman philosopher Seneca
classified it as a form of insanity. The term alcoholism, however, appears
first in the classical essay 'Alcoholismus chronicus' (1849) by the Swedish
physician Magnus Huss. The phrase chronic alcoholism rapidly became a medical
term for the condition of habitual inebriety conceived as a disease, and
the bearer of the disease was called an alcoholic or alcoholist</font></font>

<font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Alcoholism is a chronic and usually
progressive illness involving the excessive inappropriate ingestion of
ethyl alcohol, whether in the&nbsp;<img SRC="alcoholics.gif" height=90 width=104 align=RIGHT>
form of familiar alcoholic beverages or as a constituent of other substances.
There is no cure although recovery is possible. Alcoholism is thought to
arise from a combination of a wide range of physiological, psychological,
social, and genetic factors. It is characterized by an emotional and often
physical dependence on alcohol, and it frequently leads to brain damage
or early death.</font></font>

<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>More males than females are
affected, but drinking among the young and among women are increasing.
Consumption of alcohol is apparently on the rise in the United States,
countries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and many European
nations. Growing evidence of increasing numbers of alcohol-related problems
in other nations, including the Third World parallels this.</font></font>
