<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Alcoholism, as opposed to merely
excessive or irresponsible drinking, has been variously thought of as a
symptom of psychological or social stress or as a learned, maladaptive
coping behavior. More recently, and probably more accurately, it has come
to be viewed as a complex disease entity in its own right. Alcoholism usually
develops over a period of years. Early and subtle symptoms include placing
excessive importance on the availability of alcohol. Ensuring this availability
strongly influences the person's choice of associates or activities. Alcohol
comes to be used more as a mood-changing drug than as a foodstuff or beverage
served as a part of social custom or religious ritual.</font></font>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Initially, the alcoholic may
demonstrate a high tolerance to alcohol, consuming more and showing less
adverse effects than others may. Subsequently, however, the person begins
to drink against his or her own best interests, as alcohol comes to assume
more importance than personal relationships, work, reputation, or even
physical health. The person commonly loses control over drinking and is
increasingly unable to predict how much alcohol will be consumed on a given
occasion or, if the person is currently abstaining, when the drinking will
resume again. Physical addiction to the drug may occur, sometimes eventually
leading to drinking around the clock to avoid withdrawal symptoms.</font></font>
