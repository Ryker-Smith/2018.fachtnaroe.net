<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Treatment of the illness increasingly
recognizes alcoholism itself as the primary problem needing attention,
rather than regarding it as always secondary to another, underlying problem.
Specialized residential treatment facilities and separate units within
general or psychiatric hospitals are rapidly increasing in number. As the
public becomes more aware of the nature of alcoholism, the social stigma
attached to it decreases, alcoholics and their families tend to conceal
it less, and diagnosis is not delayed as long. Earlier and better treatment
has led to encouragingly high recovery rates.</font></font><img SRC="pill.gif" height=147 width=161 align=RIGHT>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>In addition to managing physical
complications and withdrawal states, treatment involves individual counseling
and group therapy techniques aimed at complete and comfortable abstinence
from alcohol and other mood-changing drugs of addiction. Such abstinence,
according to the best current evidence, is the desired goal, despite some
highly controversial suggestions that a safe return to social drinking
is possible. Addiction to other drugs, particularly to other tranquilizers
and sedatives, poses a major hazard to alcoholics. Antabuse, a drug that
produces a violent intolerance for alcohol as long as the substance remains
in the body, is sometimes used after withdrawal. Alcoholics’ Anonymous,
a support group commonly used for those undergoing other treatment, in
many cases helps alcoholics to recover without recourse to formal treatment.</font></font>
<p><font face="Humanst521 BT"><font size=+1>Despite these encouraging signs,
estimates of the annual number of deaths related to excessive drinking
exceed 97,000 in the United States alone. Economic costs related to alcoholism
are at least $100 billion a year. Additional data are needed on various
societal costs of alcoholism as well as on the costs of various modes of
treatment compared with their actual results.</font></font>
