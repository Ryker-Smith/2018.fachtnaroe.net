<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>National Alcohol Policy Ireland</H2>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Executive Summary</H2>

<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>Alcohol consumption is set to increase in the Irish population over the
next number of years, given:- the current and projected economic growth;
an anticipated increase in the number of people drinking more beer which
is less sensitive to price increases; possibly greater access to alcohol
through increased special exemptions for longer opening hours, a greater
number of young people starting to drink at a younger age and a higher percentage
of regular drinkers by the age of 18 years with a preference for beer; strong
alcohol advertising campaigns in all media in terms of volume, exposure
and extensive sponsorship promotions with high visible sports.</P>

<P><B><I>The main policy objective of this document is to promote moderation
in alcohol consumption, for those who wish to drink, and reduce the prevalence
of alcohol related problems in Ireland, thereby promoting the health of
the community. </I></B></P>

<P>The Government is delivering on the commitment of a National Alcohol
Policy and its importance is acknowledged by the government, the general
public and supported in the current trends in alcohol consumption and alcohol-related
problems.</P>

<P>The Government published the National Health Strategy <B><I>Shaping a
Healthier Future</I></B> in 1994. This was followed in July, 1995 by the
publication of the Health Promotion Strategy. Both documents referred to
the development of a national policy:</P>

<P><B>to promote moderation in alcohol consumption and reduce risks to physical,
mental and family health associated with alcohol misuse.</B></P>

<P>The National Alcohol Policy was prepared by the Health Promotion Unit
of the Department of Health and is based on the report of a Working Group
which was established by the Advisory Council on Health Promotion. It also
draws on the proceedings of the World Health Organisation Conference on
Health, Society and Alcohol which was held in Paris. The importance of a
comprehensive alcohol policy was highlighted when Ireland endorsed the European
Charter on Alcohol in December 1995 along with 48 other Member States of
the WHO European Region.</P>
