<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><font size=+1>Coursing greyhounds need to be heavier and
as such they can eat a lot more. They need this weight to be able to have
the stamina to chase the hare. In the coursing festival in Clonmel they
are always muzzled so that, even if they reach the hare they don’t tear
it apart. In Coursing, the winner is the dog who makes the hare turn off
from a straight line to the left or right first.</font></center>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br><font size=+1>The difference between racing and coursing dogs is their
weight. The sport itself is carried out using live hares who almost always
get away as the sport is carried out in an open field, whereas racing is
done on a track similar to a horse track, but smaller, the hare isn’t real
and the length of a race varies.</font>
<center><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>The Track</font></font>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>

<p><font size=+1>The track has sets of 6 traps or boxes in different areas
surrounding the track. These are some Irish race lengths: 300, 375, 500,
525, 575, 600, 700, 730 yards, but there can be different lengths in other
countries. Starting off greyhounds usually just race the shorter lengths
and further down the line can race in the longer races as their hearts
can withstand the pace. In Ireland and Great Britain, the hare is always
black but in America the hare is always white.</font>
<p><font size=+1>There are spectator stands around the track and as the
dogs can go so fast the race is timed in seconds. A good time for a 525
yard race is 29.80 seconds. Our greyhound ‘Jenny’ did this time before
Christmas and came first.</font>

<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>

<p><font size=+1>Sadly, as with all sport, injury is very common in greyhounds.
As they are allergic to general anastethic, surgery is almost impossible.
So, if they have the misfortune of breaking a limb they may have to be
put to sleep. Scratches and bruises heal in their own time, but special
care is needed to make sure cuts don’t develop into infections, which can
be nasty and costly to get rid of.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The dogs have to be massaged regularly, to make sure they
don’t get stiff muscles or drag muscles and ligaments prior to a race.
This keeps the joints supple and relaxes a nervous greyhound. They also
need to be brushed with a soft brush to develop their coat.</font>
