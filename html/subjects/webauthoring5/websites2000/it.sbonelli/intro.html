<hr WIDTH="100%"><font size=+1>The greyhound is synomonous with Clonmel.
They are even on the coat of Arms for the town. The greyhound is a beautiful
dog that has grace and dignity when seen in action. The only dog to be
mentioned in the Bible they also were buried with their masters in Egyptian
tombs the greyhound has a wonderful history.</font></center>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br><font size=+1>I chose to do this site on greyhounds as I have a racing
greyhound at home and I have become interested in racing since then. Before
I had “Jenny” I thought greyhounds to be vicious animals who tear apart
other dogs and animals and even small children. But, I now know that greyhounds
have the gentlest temperament and would rather run away from a screaming
child than attack it.</font>

<p><font size=+1>They are also very loyal. “Jenny” will not stray very
far from my mother’s side, even off the lead and she is always watching
to see where my mother will go next. She can be mischievous though, sometimes
stealing clothes from the line and boots from the back door if she is not
let in when she wants to.</font>
<p><font size=+1>This web site is going to deal with the anatomy of greyhounds,
their diets, the difference between coursing and racing dogs and anything
else to do with them. I will also have an example of a racing sheet and
some rules for the racing clubs. If you are just browsing and looking around
and know nothing about greyhounds then, this site may be of use to you.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Clonmel racetrack is now closed but there are talks to
resume the racing here. The nearest place to race is Thurles or Waterford,
which can be hard to find transport to get to. Clonmel racetrack was really
missed this year at the annual coursing festival held in Clonmel. A lot
of the tourists commented on when it would be open again and would it open
in time for next year’s festival. This remains to be seen but everyone
hopes it will, as it was a great asset to the town.</font>
