<blockquote><font size=+1>The race day begins the night before by resting
the greyhound and not walking her. The next morning she is not given much
food until after the race. But depending on what time she is racing at
a small meal is given to her to keep her going as it isn’t fair to keep
her hungry all day.</font>
<p><font size=+1>As stated before, the dogs are locked up until it’s time
for the race when they are collected by their owners and paraded by their
owners on the track before going to traps. The traps swing on to the track
and the dogs are put into them. The signal is given to start the electronic
hare and the race begins.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It is all over very quickly and afterwards the owner waters
down the dog and when they get home, she is fed and her paws are washed
down. She is also checked for injuries, which may happen a lot but more
often are not serious. A drink to stop them dehydrating is also given to
them and then they are fed and put to bed.</font>
