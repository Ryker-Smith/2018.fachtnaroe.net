<blockquote><font size=+1>I hope this has been a help to the reader in
understanding greyhounds. As I’ve said before they are really misunderstood
and are not the vicious animals that people make them out to be. Even the
coursing greyhounds look vicious as they chase the hare but it really does
not come to any harm as the dogs must have a muzzle when chasing the hare.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The dogs really enjoy themselves on the race track and
in training, as I should know. Our greyhound just loves the sound of the
hare going around the track and all the running around. But, after their
race days are over it is important to remember that greyhounds still need
all that attention. It makes me so angry to see abandoned greyhounds found
in pitying states by the ISPCA and RSPCA but there are organisations out
there to help. They are all over the USA, Britain, New Zealand and Ireland
and Canada. They make it possible to adopt these unwanted dogs and give
light at the end of the tunnel for those who never make it in the racing
world. It is nice to know some people do care about these animals because
after all, they have feelings too.</font>
