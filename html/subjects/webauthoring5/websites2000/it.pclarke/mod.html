<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>In primitive boat building, the
builder often used width of hand, length of forearm, and length between
knuckles as units of measurement. Notched sticks also were used for measuring.
More advanced building methods, using moulds, required that the keel, the
stem, and the stern-post be set up on stakes or blocks and that an arbitrary
mid-ship frame be erected in place. The curved members required for this
frame were made from moulds, used by shifting the butts to produce boats
of varying size but similar form.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>After the mid-section frame was
put in place, two or more battens on each side were secured, one to form
the sheer line, one along the turn of the bilge, and one, quite often,
along the ends of the floor timbers, or short frame members, that crossed
the keel. Sometimes other battens were fitted between the bilge and sheer
battens and between the bilge and floor-head battens. Individual frame
members were then shaped to fit inside the battens at selected intervals;
when all the frames were made, the battens were removed and the hull planked.
All frames were hewn from crooked timber.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>The Half-model</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>The next development in boat
building was the use of drawings and the builders' half-model. Using drawings
to delineate the shape of the hull apparently evolved slowly, but records
are obscure. Similarly, little is known of the evolution of the half-model,
but it appears to have developed along with the use of drawings. It is
known that the use of such plans was common in 16th-century England, during
the reign of Queen Elizabeth 1, and Mediterranean builders probably employed
crude drawings at least as early as the beginning of the 15th century.
According to scale, and then, in a process known as lofting, a full-size
drawing of the ship or boat was made. By 1800, drawing up the plans for
ships and boats was fully developed, as was the lofting process.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>The use of the half-model in
lieu of the reduced-scale drawing appears to have originated in Europe
at an early date; by the early 18th century carving a model from a solid
block of wood was a popular method of design in commercial boatyards and
shipyards. The shape of the model was determined by the judgement and art
of its maker. The sections needed to form the mould frames controlling
the hull shape of the boat were obtained by sawing the model at the desired
transverse mould stations and scaling off these sections by drawing ordinates.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Lift Models and Lofting</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>By the middle of the 18th century,
builders had developed another type of model, consisting of a blackboard
cut to the shape of the hull profile, with the sections formed of thin
plank secured at the desired mould stations. The sections were made fair,
or capable of being planked smoothly, by battens at suitable locations.
Finally, about 1795, the so-called lift model was developed, made of boards
of equal thickness pegged together and shaped to the desired hull form.
The shape of the mould frames was obtained by taking the model apart and
tracing the shape of the lifts, or planks, in their proper relation to
one another. By drawing lines across these shapes at frame stations, the
transverse widths at the ordinates formed by the lift thicknesses could
be determined. The lift model is still in use in many boatyards and remains
practical for small craft.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Lofting consists of drawing the
full-size shape of the hull on a suitable platform or floor. The required
drawing shows the mould sections, or transverse forms, usually five to
seven in number. These sections usually are tested by drawing in some longitudinal
curves, such as the sheer, and a few waterlines or level lines duplicating
the so-called lift lines of a half-model. In addition, buttock and bow
lines, longitudinal vertical sections parallel to the centreline of the
hull, may be used. Diagonals, representing the batten curves over the moulds,
may be drawn in. In making the longitudinal drawing, the profile of the
hull usually is drawn full size. Lofting is an important operation in boat
building, for it is the only way a design may be reproduced accurately
or repeatedly. In the more advanced boat shops the structural details also
are drawn full size, the lofting being done in minute detail.</font></font></b></center>
