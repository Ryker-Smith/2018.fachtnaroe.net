large water craft is properly called a ship; however, the boundary between
boats and ships cannot be defined with precision. Some larger vessels today
are called boats, although they exceed in length some ships of colonial
America. In naval architecture, however, a craft less than 20 m (65 ft)
in length is considered a boat.</font>
<p><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Boats are classified primarily by
method of propulsion-for example, sailboat, motorboat, and rowboat. They
are also classified according to function, method of construction and type
of materials used, rigging (in sailboats), and other factors described
in this article.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Only a few basic component parts
are common to most boats of traditional style. The keel is a timber or
other element running the length of the centre bottom of a boat from the
bow, or front, to the stern, or rear. The keel serves as the "foundation"
for the frame, which is covered by a waterproof material to form hull-the
body, or bulwark, of the boat. These terms are also used in describing
modern boats that are not built but are moulded in one piece</font></font>
