<p><br><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Lapstrake Construction</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>In northern Europe, Lapstrake,
or overlapping, construction was developed to a high</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>order by the 9th century, particularly
by the Scandinavians. Lapstrake is also known as clinch-built or clinker-built
construction. Planks apparently were split off a log by means of wedges,
or they were hewn and assembled on the keel, one after another beginning
with the garboard, the lowest. In the Viking ships and boats of the 10th
century and somewhat later, lashings were still used to secure the planks
to the frames. Such construction resulted in a very flexible hull, yet
one of relatively great strength. The lashings eventually were replaced
by through fastenings, that is, by pegs, and later were replaced by nails
driven into the planking and frames.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>In lapstrake construction the
longitudinal seams of the planking are formed by lapping</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>the edges enough to allow continuous
nailing. Thus, the skin, or exterior planking, adds strength to the boat.
Frames are then added to give the required stiffness of form. Originally
the frames were hewn of natural-crook timber, including root or limb knees
and crooked trunks. Steam-bent frames became popular in the early 19th
century.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Carvel Construction</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>The smooth-planked, or carve]-built,
boat was developed in the Mediterranean region</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>and was probably a natural evolution
of the craft constructed of short planks bolted edge to edge used by the
ancient Egyptians. Plank and frame construction was probably fully developed
before ancient Greece rose to maritime prominence. As in lapstrake construction,
the use of pegs probably preceded the use of metal fastenings between plank
and framing.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>A framing system made of almost
equally spaced transverse frames fastened to a continuous keel and strengthened
by a pair of gunwales running from bow to stern was a logical step in the
development of smooth-planked boats. The problem of seam leakage was met
by using wood tar and caulking material, as in earlier lapstrake craft.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>In so-called smooth-lap construction,
developed in the 19th century, plank edges are rabbeted, that is, shaped,
so that they lap and still remain smooth at the seams; the rabbeted laps
are nailed in the usual lapstrake manner. In the early 20th century the
use of lapstrake construction decreased, while carvel construction became
more popular. The shift was caused largely by the need for extreme structural
strength, as a result of the introduction of motors in small boats, and
to demands for fast sailing craft used for racing.</font></font></b></center>
