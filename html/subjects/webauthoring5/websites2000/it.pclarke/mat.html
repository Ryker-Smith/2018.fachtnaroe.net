<blockquote>
<center><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Wooden Boats</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Craft constructed of wood planks
appear to have been developed gradually from the modified dugout made during
the Bronze Age or even earlier. Log-construction methods were exhibited
also in ancient Egyptian boats, in which short planks, or balks, of timber
were bolted edge to edge to form a hull. Framing and planking are the basic
components of wooden boats. The frame is used to support and stiffen the
hull, including the stem, keel, keelson, ribs, knees, and wales. The planking
is the outer shell that is fastened to the framing.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Plywood Construction.</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Plywood boat construction began
in the United States about 1918 and developed rapidly; the two basic types
are panelled and moulded. Panel construction involves securing flat sheets
of plywood to transverse frames and to the keel and other units that supply
longitudinal strength; it is used only with chine-model boats, that is,
those with flat bottoms or V-bottoms. The amount of compound curve that
may be used in a plywood panel is extremely limited.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>In moulded-plywood construction
the form of the boat is established by temporary transverse frames, or
moulds, and by longitudinal battens (thin, narrow strips of lumber often
used to seal or reinforce joints), over which the planking is placed in
two or three layers. The first skin is laid on diagonally and secured to
the form by staples. Two or three skins are used, and after stapling, the
mould is moved into a heating and pressure stage in which adhesion of the
skins is accomplished. After adhesion, stiffeners and joinery are added;
these usually include keelson, shoe, gunwale, guards, thwarts, decking,
outside stem, transom (in a square-stern boat), and centerboard case and
mast step (in a sailing hull).</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Canvas-covered Boats</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>In the construction of canvas-covered
small boats, very thin planking is laid over light steam-bent frames; then
canvas is stretched tightly over the hull by clamps and a tackle at bow
and stern. After the canvas is secured, it is coated with a thin primer
or is first wetted with water. The canvas shrinks as it dries, making a
smooth surface. The canvas is then painted, outside guards are fitted at
the gunwales, and an external keel and stempost and sternpost are fitted.
The result is a light and tight boat suited for easy carrying and occasional
use.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Aluminium Boats</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>The first aluminium boats to
be built in the United States were for the polar expedition of the American
journalist and explorer Waiter Weliman in 1894, although the first known
use of aluminium was in Europe in 1891. After World War 11, aluminium boats
became common, usually in the form of canoes or simple craft used for sport
fishing. These boats are built from sheets of aluminium, perhaps given
curvature by stamping, and fastened together with rivets. Sandwich-type
constructions, intended to increase both lightness and strength, are under
development.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Ferro-cement Boats</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Ferro-cement, a closely spaced
wire mesh made watertight by plastering of concrete, has some advantage
for boats that must be built in small numbers by unskilled workers without
sophisticated tools. Waterproof cloth can be formed into boat-shaped bags,
then inflated to make small craft that are quite suitable and popular for
some uses.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Fibreglass Boats</font></font></u></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>The greatest number of boats
today are moulded from composite plastic materials. The mould is a cavity
having the exact shape of the boat. Construction of the boat involves (1)
coating the interior of the cavity with a liquid plastic; (2) laying on
reinforcing material in the form of a cloth or mat of fibre’s; (3) saturating
the reinforcing material with liquid plastic; (4) possibly applying a layer
of lightweight core material; and (5) applying more reinforcing and plastic.
The plastic hardens under the action of a catalyst that has been mixed
with it; heat may be applied to hasten the hardening action. The result
is a hull of great strength and relatively light weight that has been built
quickly and without the necessity for great skill on the part of builders.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>In many cases, interior structure,
such as bulkheads and foundations for an engine, is inserted while the
hull is in the mould, and then is bonded to the hull by the plastic and
its reinforcement.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>The plastic used is generally
a resin of the polyester type. Epoxy and vinyl ester resins are also used.
The reinforcing material is often a glass fibre, giving rise to the generic
term "fibreglass boat." Structures of successively greater strength and
stiffness for a given weight can be produced with aramid (often identified
as Kevlar, a proprietary name) or carbon fibre reinforcement. These materials
cost more than glass and, hence are found only in applications where their
properties are essential to the result.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>A core is required to give the
composite structure the thickness needed for adequate stiffness and to
make it resistant to puncture. If the part being moulded is a flat sheet,</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>such as an interior bulkhead,
the core is likely to be a sheet of plywood. If a low-weight bulkhead is
required, aluminium formed into a honeycomb is a likely core' Sheets of
balsa wood or PVC (polyvinyl chloride) plastic can also be used where lightness
is important. For the sharp curvature common to boat hulls, the core sheets
are provided with the material cut into small squares and attached to a
cloth sheet. With balsa, they are arranged with the grain of the wood perpendicular
to the sheet; the final structure then has a high resistance to impacts
and crushing loads because of the natural strength of wood in the direction
of its fibres</font></font></b></center>
