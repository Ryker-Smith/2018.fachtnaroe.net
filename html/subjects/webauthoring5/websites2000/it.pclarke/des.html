<font color="#000066">Basics of Boat Design</font></h1></center>

<center>
<p><br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Boats of some utility can
be built with only the most elementary thought for design; a gathering
of fallen logs at the edge of a stream, lashed together to make a crude
raft, is an extreme example. Over the many centuries of boat use and boat
building, such crude beginnings grew by intuition and trial-and-error into
an array of sophisticated and highly satisfactory craft.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Buoyancy and Weight</font></font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Any object that is to float upon
the water surface must sink until it has displaced a volume of water of
equal weight. Thus, if, for example, a boat is to carry three people, their
fishing gear, an outboard motor, and a supply of fuel-a total weight of
1,000 pounds-then the boat must be made long and large enough to displace
1,000 pounds of water without sinking below standard level. The design
task must take into account that the boat has its own weight that also
must be displaced; therefore, the greater the weight of the material that
is used to build the boat, the larger the size of the boat.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Trim and Stability</font></font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>After the underwater volume of
a boat is designed to meet the requirement that the weight of the boat
and its contents equals the weight of the water displaced, the distribution
of weights must be suitably arranged. The weight of an outboard motor at
the stern of a small boat tends to make it sink deeply in the water at
that end (to "trim the stern"). if that tendency cannot be offset by placement
of a similar weight in the forward end of the boat, then the offsetting
must be obtained by broadening the hull at its aft end so that a greater
part of the displacement occurs near the excess weight.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>A balance of weights from side
to side must also be arranged. Further, to lessen the danger of capsizing,
the combined centre of gravity of all weights must be sufficiently low
in the boat. If other factors make it necessary that the centre of gravity
be high, then the chance of capsizing must be offset by increasing the
width of the hull.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Structure</font></font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>A boat must maintain its shape
in the face of local internal weights, such as an engine or a heavy cargo,
and when buffeted externally by waves. If the boat is stiff enough to</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>resist major deflections, it
is almost certainly strong enough to resist fractures. On the other hand,
since a hull of sufficient strength can be built of thin material, the
risk of local puncture can be great in a boat that is otherwise quite strong.
A traditional boat built of skins or of bark and a modern inflatable boat
are examples of this circumstance.</font></font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Water-tightness</font></font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066"><font size=+1>Part of the structural problem
is water-tightness-the prevention of leakage through the joints of adjoining
pieces. For boats of wooden planking, a caulking between planks was commonly
used; the caulking might be fibre threads, pitch, or a combination of these
materials. For boats of skin or bark, filling of interstices with pitch
was common practice. The contemporary practice of moulding a hull obviates
several of the traditional problems. Without seams there is no possibility
of leakage.</font></font></b></center>
