<blockquote><font size=+3>Why traveling?</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>To travel is very often just to experience the best bits
of each country. When traveling in Asia you see all these amazing&nbsp;
historical buildings like the Taj Mahal, Palace of the winds and many others.&nbsp;
Mingle with people of different colors, creed and race. Small villages
along the trek surrounded by mountains with high peaks covered with snow
or a peaceful group of cluttered bamboo huts under the palm trees to seek
shade from the burning sun, a lot of different flora and fauna that you
never get to see any where else. The long white sandy beaches, the sparkling
clear water and hills covered with coconut trees. You get your&nbsp; share
of smiles, shy smiles from the Nepalese and friendly&nbsp; open smiles
from the Thai people. You also get to see if you look a bit behind the
beauty, that everyone is not as fortunate as us. Not everyone is born in
a country&nbsp; where we almost take for granted to have food on the table,
nice clothes&nbsp; and a house to live in.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It is impossible to&nbsp; take in or even&nbsp; understand
how it's to live without food and with just one dirty piece of fabric to
cover your body. Never even own a pair of shoes, not even a blanket to
cover your body during the night. To see your child's eyes glossy with
fever asking for food and not having anything to give him today either.
To see your child get weaker and weaker without being able to do anything.
To know that this is the way it will always be, and&nbsp; that I have no
power to change it. Can you imagine this? This is the reality for many
millions of people&nbsp; around the world.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I wish I could say that this was my reason for traveling.
To meet and understand people from different countries and cultures. I
suppose some of it was, but&nbsp; I'm afraid&nbsp; my reason for traveling
was a bit more selfish. I&nbsp; had itchy feet and wanted to see what was
out there with my own eyes. I discovered though that the world is a very
big&nbsp; place. Even if I&nbsp; traveled for a few years I just got to
see a very small part of it. There is still so much left&nbsp; to see.
Which is nice to know if I ever get itchy feet again that there are still
lots of undiscovered places waiting to be discovered.</font>
