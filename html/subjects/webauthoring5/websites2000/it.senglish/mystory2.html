<hr SIZE=7 WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=+1>After India and Calcutta is was a relief to sit down and
relax and let the bus take us to&nbsp; Nepal. I couldn't wait to see the
mountains and breathe the fresh air. Before we started the journey we were
not fully aware that this trip would take over two days in an overcrowded
bus with sometimes cackling hens and other times baling sheep before we
would finally reach our destination. When we started out I was sitting
next to a woman with a big&nbsp; apron on her dress. After a while I had
a feeling that she was looking at me. I tried not to look but she must
have figured that I seemed to be a friendly person because she started
to smile, took out an egg of her apron pocket ,peeled it and handed it
to me. I suppose I looked half starved after losing a stone in India. I
thought the gesture was very nice but did not know what to do as I just
couldn't make my self eat an egg in this dirty and overcrowded bus. I smiled
back and shook my head in what I thought polite way. I don't think she
took any offense as she after a while ate the egg herself. Somebody thought
of a brilliant idea of climbing up on the roof of the bus together with
our luggage. The view was incredible . It was&nbsp; much nicer up here
in&nbsp; the fresh air and we did not have to share the space with hens
and&nbsp; sheep either.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We were slowly getting higher and higher up into the mountains
on a very narrow road. The roads here are very dangerous. The mountain
is on one side and on the other,&nbsp; nothing just fresh air.. When the
bus was turning a bend the driver beeped the horn and if he did not hear
anything he carried on. If somebody beeped on the other side of the corner
the driver would slow down and let them pass. I could never figure out
who was supposed to go first, the veichele coming from left or right.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The landscape was breathtaking with the mountains and
the blue river down below. Lots of birds in all different colors and monkeys&nbsp;
hanging out of the trees and playfully running alongside the bus. After
a&nbsp; day of&nbsp; traveling we saw that there were busses in front of
us and finally we had to stop. Everyone wondered what&nbsp; the reason
was&nbsp; for a traffic jam up here in the mountains. We soon enough&nbsp;
found out that the reason for the stop was a bus that had accidentally
driven off the road. The bus had plunged into the river 50 meters down.
We heard that all forty people on the bus had died. This tragic accident&nbsp;
made us forget about the beauty around us for a while.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>Katmandu</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>We eventually reached Katmandu which is the capital of
Nepal. We did the usual trip to the G.P.O and got a load of letters from
family and friends back home. We only wished that they knew how much a
letter meant to us. Katmandu is a nice city where the history of the country
and the increasing modernization meet in one place. We were delighted when
we booked in to our accommodation and&nbsp; saw that the bathroom had a
proper toilet and nearly clean sheets. According to our by now trained
eye only&nbsp; one had slept in them sheets&nbsp; before. We went out to
look at this city and found that you need a lot of patience to find you
way on these narrow and often unnamed streets. People were very helpful
though when you couldn't find your way. There was lots of ancient&nbsp;
temples and shrines with carved doors and windows. Also lots of souvenir
sellers offering all kind of services and things to bring home. We also
needed to gear up for our trip up in the mountains. Coming from India we
had no warm jumpers and trekking boots. As we were living on a budget our
trainers had to do for the trekking but we bought jumpers to keep us warm
when up in the mountains.</font>
<p><font size=+1>When it comes to food the Nepalese food is fairly tasteless
compared to their Indian cousins. On the other hand you can get anything
here from Swedish smorgasbord to Mexican tacos, Thai chocolate and lots
of other things. We had our first meal of meat that we had had in months.
I think it was buffalo steak and not very nice at all very tough. After
a few days of wining, dining and shopping we got the bus to Phokara, a
small town west of Katmandu.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>Trekking</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>This is where most people start out their trekking from
and this was the reason why we were here. Our plan was to do a seven day
trek in the Annapurna region which&nbsp; is the bottom part of mount Everest.
We had to register for a&nbsp; trekking permit,&nbsp; this is so they know
how many people are up in the mountains. If you are not back the day you
said you would be they should start looking for you hopefully. We packed
our rucksack and stored&nbsp; unnecessary belongings in a storage safe.
We were fit but there was no need to carry more weight then necessary.
I started off with a rucksack that weighed 20 kilo, a sleeping bag, lots
of film and an exited mind.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The walk was fairly easy but&nbsp; in some places it was
a bit harder where you were walking uphill for hours. We walked for approximately
six hours the first day. The incredible beautiful views with small villages
on the side of the mountains and the polite Nepalese people made you forget
about the hard work. We stopped and slept in the village where we got accommodation
and food.&nbsp; After four days we came to Ghorepani This was the place&nbsp;
we wanted to reach before the climb down. At five a clock in the morning
we climbed up on Phoon Hill where we could see some of the highest peaks
in the Himalayas in the sunrise. It was almost divine to see the sun slowly
rise and you could see one after another of the white peaks. This&nbsp;
picture will always stay in my mind.</font>
