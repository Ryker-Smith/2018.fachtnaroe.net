<p><b><font size=+2>Bangkok</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>After looking at historical evidence of the past four
months both in India and Nepal we decided to take it easy and relax a while.
Nothing&nbsp; amazed us any longer and we could not see the beauty in other
wise beautiful places and buildings. When you have seen so much it's time
to do something else. So we just wanted to relax,&nbsp; lay on the beach
looking up into the clear blue sky through the coconut tree leaves, soak
up the sun and swim in the sparkling lagoons. This was also part of traveling&nbsp;
We figured Thailand was the place to do this as the&nbsp; Thai are&nbsp;
known for their friendliness and hospitality to strangers. So we got on
the plane and landed in Bangkok a few hours later.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Bangkok is the capital of Thailand and a very modern city.
One reason why we went was that we had heard that Thailand was an easy
country to travel in with efficient transport. We had had enough of sharing
seats with chickens and hens and it would also be nice to travel without
worrying if the car would break down or not. When we got our taxi the driver
did not seem to&nbsp; have any speed limit but he seemed to navigate well
in this huge metropolis with ten lanes of traffic in each direction in
some places. All of a sudden a man stepped out into our lane in front of
the taxi. The driver had no chance to avoid the collision and drove straight
into him. The man bounced&nbsp; into our windscreen which broke with millions
of pieces of glass raining over us. The driver slammed on the brakes and
finally stopped, the man rolled of our bonnet and fell down in front of
the car. The whole incident was over in matter of seconds. We were in shock,
following the whole incident as it felt like it was shown in slow motion.
We&nbsp; were sure he was dead. Like in a horror movie (except this time
we wanted it to happen) the man stood up like nothing had happened and
brushed off his cloths, he had some&nbsp; blood on his face but otherwise
he looked&nbsp; fine, not at all like he had been driven over by a car.
He just wanted to walk off but we insisted on taking him to the hospital
which he finally agreed to. I think we were more shook up after the incident
then he was.</font>
<p><font size=+1>After booking into some cheap accommodation in Cosan Road
which is the back packing street in Bangkok we went out for a few beers
to calm our nerves. We were all sitting at a table with a few other people
talking and having a good time. Some one offered us a drink out of a bottle
which we accepted. After this drink I felt a sudden dizziness coming over
me. I told my friend I wasn't feeling well and went out to the bathroom.
I felt that something was definitely wrong with me. I just didn't&nbsp;
know what it was so I asked somebody to get my friends as I was just feeling
worse by the minute. At this stage I was almost unconscious and they had
to carry me out the back door into a waiting taxi. I can't remember anything
from being in the bathroom until midday the day after. I can never say
for sure but I'm almost certain someone put something into my drink. I
was just&nbsp; lucky that I had my friends with me. It would have been
very easy for anyone to take of my money belt that I always carried around
my waist&nbsp; and take my travelers&nbsp; cheques and visa card. In Thailand
anyone can cash in cheques and sign for your visa card.</font>
<p><font size=+1>After these two experiences in one day&nbsp; we wanted
to get out of Bangkok. First we wanted to go to pick up our mail. There
is a taxi service on the river in Thailand and this was the quickest way
to GPO. The boat trip vas nice, the boat stopped in every little corner
to let people off or on. We reached our destination and it was reassuring
and calming to read that everything was like it always had been back home
in Sweden. The world had not gone mad after all and this made me feel a
bit better.</font>
<p><b><font size=+2>Phi Phi Islands</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>But we still decided to get some peace and quiet so we
booked a ticket to go down south to a small Island called phi phi. The
travel took a day or so by bus and boat. When we finally came there it
was well worth the effort. There they were, the white sandy beaches perfect
for long walks and for early jogging. There was the sparkling blue water
made for swimming and snorkeling and the whole Island covered with coconut
palms. There were not many tourist and even not that many locals. There
was just a few restaurants, a pub made out of bamboo, where you could sit
on the floor outside on the warm evenings. We spent many evenings here
meeting other travelers like us, giving and receiving information about
places to go to and not go to. We rented a small bungalow right by the
beach. This was what we had been looking for so we stayed for three weeks
. We ate the excellent Thai food and for dessert juicy water melon or bright
yellow papaya picked on the island. Some&nbsp; days we were swimming and
snorkeling with white sharks and lots of other colorful tropical fish and
other living things. It was just like heaven. Just like anything else that
you don't want to end this ended to soon.</font>
<p><b><font size=+2>Ko Samui</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>One of the&nbsp; reason for traveling in the first place
was to meet people and see different places. This time we went to the second
biggest Island in Thailand called Ko Samui and located south east of Bangkok.
This Island was even ten years ago very exploited&nbsp; and full of western
tourists. Some people where there to see the beautiful Thailand and this
country is definitely beautiful. Others were too busy&nbsp; looking for
some bought love of some young prostituted boy or girl to see the beauty
of this country. It was sad to see how some tourist nurtured this trade
of young poor boys and girls that had to be prostituted to maybe feed their
whole family.</font>
<p><font size=+1>For us others, the party life was good and we met lots
of people and had a lovely time celebrating both Christmas and the New
year. After extending&nbsp; our stay a few times I steeped on a glass bottle
walking home bare feet from the pub one evening. I had to be brought to
the doctor as the blood was pouring out of my foot and wouldn't stop no
matter how I tried to put on the bandage. I had to have ten stitches in
the end. Because of the infection risk I had to take very strong antibiotics
so I had to stay indoors for a week and I can tell you that the heat was
not so pleasant when staying in a boiling bungalow with no air conditioning.
After a week we took the bus up to Bangkok and booked our flight out of
Thailand. The adventure was over for this time.</font>
