<p><b><font size=+2>New Delhi</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>We landed in New Delhi, early in the morning. From the
airplane window we could see the white airport buildings, through the morning
mist. Every thing looked so different from what we had left behind. A gray
rainy October day&nbsp; in Stockholm. Eventually we got off the plane and
got our bags. It was very busy even at this early hour. The heat was unbelievable
as we worked our way through the crowd and this was supposed to be the
cool season according to our travel guide. I couldn't even imagine the
heat in the hot season. We were heading towards something that looked like
cabs. After a bit off haggling about the price we got our&nbsp; taxi.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The road was very dusty with pot holes everywhere. The
driver drove like a maniac. I don't think he used the brake once. He was
constantly using the horn and was almost standing on the accelerator. Maybe
we hadn't paid him enough. We learned soon enough that this way of driving
was common practice. We looked out through our taxi window trying our best
to take our mind off this life threatening journey.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Out there was a very serene and beautiful landscape. Big
trees with leafs hanging out&nbsp; to give shade to the people working
in the sun. Cows were strolling alongside the road. In India cows are holy
creatures and can't be killed so they are everywhere. To me it looked as
if it would have been more humane to kill some of them. Women with layers
and layers of beautiful colored fabric wrapped around them. Walking towards
what looked like rice fields, probably on their way to work. Men on rusty
bikes that had seen better days. Children walking hand in hand with no
shoes, not that they needed any anyway. Here and there elephants with big
loads on their backs, on their way somewhere.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=+1>If the countryside was peaceful, New Delhi was
different. I had never seen a place so crowded. I suppose the 900 million
that populates India had to be somewhere. We were surrounded by people
everywhere, pushing, shoving, shouting. It was difficult to get used to
all the noise. We booked in to a hostel that looked reasonable clean. Soon
enough we realized it was not just the cool weather we had left behind.
When we went to the bathroom we discovered that there was no toilet, just
a hole in the ground. This was not so bad but&nbsp; there where no toilet
paper either. We heard later that&nbsp; you are supposed to use your left
hand. I like to think of myself as someone who can easily adapt to different
customs but this was a bit much, even for me. No matter how long we stayed
I don't think I could ever get used to that idea. So we went out toilet
paper searching. We got our toilet paper from a corner store down the street,
where they sold anything from sweets to toilet paper.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Everything seemed to happen on the streets. There were
different activities going around all day. On one street you could see
people sleeping, washing their hair, going to the toilet. At the same time
as somebody else is cooking breakfast under a primitive shelter nearby.
India is a country full of contradictions. From people who are extremely
rich to unbelievable poor, walking on the same street. Fat people, from
head&nbsp; to toe covered in gold jewelry. To most people gold is a sign
of wealth, here to be overweight shows the same thing. I suppose in a country
where food is scarce it's natural. Sick and poor people begging for money
or something to eat, outside restaurants and shops.</font>
<br><font size=+1>India had definitely made a big impression on us after
a week. Many times we just wanted to give everything we had away and go
home. I felt so guilty traveling around looking at others peoples misery
when they didn't even have food for the day. At night we couldn't sleep,
during the day we couldn't talk. It was all too much to take in.</font>
<p><b><font size=+2>Agra</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>We went to see the beautiful Agra and of course the amazing
Taj Mahal which is one of the seven wonders of the world. The building
is absolutely marvelous. Built in white marble with towers and pinnacles.
Taj Mahal is a memorial to Mumtaz Muhal built by her husband. She died
in childbirth, after fourteen children&nbsp; and seventeen years of marriage.
He also wanted to build a memorial for himself. This was suppose to be
built in black marble, opposite Taj Mahal. His children stopped him this
time, according to the story. Before we went to see the building we were
told to drink a yogurt drink called 'bang lassie'. So we did. It was only
afterwards we realized the drink was not only made of yogurt. Maybe that's
why the building was so pleasant and the park surrounding it, so peaceful.
But I don't think that was the reason.</font>
<p><b><font size=+2>Varanasi</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Varanasi is another place you go to , in India. We decided
to go and see the holy river Ganges. Every fateful Hindu wishes to go on
a pilgrimage to this river when they feel death draw near. If you die here
your soul goes straight to heaven, hopefully. No wonder it's so crowded!
There is always a smell of burnt flesh in the air. As they bring their
dead to be cremated on the banks of the river. You can even see dead people
going&nbsp; up in flames, in the evenings. The river serves other purposes
as well. In the morning you can see lines and lines of clothing drying
on the riverbank. The river is also used for bathing. People of all different
ages swimming, cleaning and even brushing their teeth. Dead cows and all
sorts of thing floating around in this brown water. The amazing thing is,&nbsp;
I didn't hear of any major epidemics while I was there. So I nearly started
to believe it my self, that this water was holy. I didn't go for a swim
though, just in case.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I loved the food, even if it didn't agree with my&nbsp;
stomach most of the time. I lost over a stone in two months. The food&nbsp;
in many places is served without eating utensils. You are supposed to scoop
up the food with your fingers, though not with those on your left hand.
You would think in a country where cows are holy everyone would be vegetarians.
This is not the case but most foods are made of spices, curry, or chili
and are served with bread or rice. I still go to Indian restaurants just
to be reminded of how nice the food can taste, and you don't have to go
to the trouble of eating it with your fingers.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>Calcutta</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Calcutta was our last stop in India. This city is often
called 'City of joy'. I couldn't see much joy here. Overcrowded streets
with many really poor areas. We went to work with Mother Theresa's organisation
when we were there. We wanted to feel less guilty I suppose or at least
like we were doing something. There wasn't much I could do though as I
have no nursing qualifications. The 'clinic' was set up under a shelter
on the street. Sick people queuing for help&nbsp; from morning to late
in the evening.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We stayed in a Salvation army hostel. The bed was covered
with lice. Every morning&nbsp; when we woke up we were covered with small
red&nbsp; bites all over. When we got out of bed we put our sleeping bags
inside out and hung them in the hot sun so they would be killed but they
were always back the next night. We heard that somebody a few doors down
from us had got malaria. We went to the hospital for more malaria tablets.
After a few weeks in Calcutta we needed some peace and fresh air, so we
said good bye to India.</font>
