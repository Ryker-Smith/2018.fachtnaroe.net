<p>Your strength and the wind determine how much of the Old Course Hotel
<br>grounds you overfly. If you have avoided Cheape's bunker, you probably
<br>have 200yd (180m) to go. Don't try it - it's too dangerous. Hit the
ball
<br>190yd (170m) up the right of the fairway, then pitch on - very carefully.
<br>The green is raised, wide and shallow, and is set at an angle to the
fairway.
<br>The road runs behind the green, inviting disaster. The Road bunker
is cut
<br>into the front of the green, which is contoured towards it. If you
avoid
<br>pitching into it, you can always putt into it. Many do so.</center>
