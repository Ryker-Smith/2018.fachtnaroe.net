<p>It looks so simple from the elevated tee to hit the green far below
with as little as a 9 iron, especially
<br>as the prevailing wind helps. But the green is dangerously narrow,
surrounded on the front and to the left
<br>by deeppot bunkers. Anything cut or pushed breaks away into a deep
chasm on the right from which saving
<br>par is almost impossible. It's best to play a club more than you think
- there's little trouble at the back. Even
<br>then, it's difficult to get down in 2 putts on a green full of little
borrows and undulations.</center>
