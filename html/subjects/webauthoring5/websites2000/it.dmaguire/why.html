<HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER>

<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Most teenagers take up smoking
as an experiment. This experimentation usually becomes an addiction. Even
though they are aware of the dangers of smoking, they don’t think it can
happen to them.</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#993366"></FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=+1>Others are lead it into it by peer
pressure and by their friends influences. It is their way to rebel against
the older generation.</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#993366"></FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=+1>If even one parent smokes it is
very likely that the child will also smoke. Children look up to their parents
for guidance and when they see a parent smoking they will think its all
right and couldn’t be dangerous.</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#993366"></FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=+1>The smoking rate with teenage girls
is a lot higher than the smoking rate with teenage boys. This maybe because
a lot of young girls worry a lot about their weight so they think by smoking
it will keep their weight down.</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#993366"></FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=+1>One of the biggest influences on
the younger generation is advertising. Most adds are aimed at the young
because they replace the older generation of smokers when they die.</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#993366"></FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT SIZE=+1>There are no serious laws against
underage smokers. Cigarettes are easily consumed from a vending machine.</FONT></FONT>
