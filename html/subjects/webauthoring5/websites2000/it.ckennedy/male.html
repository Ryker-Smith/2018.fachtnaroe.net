<U>Testes</U>
<P>
The cetacean testes is a fairly elongated cylindrical organ with an almost white, smooth shiny surface. It is located in the abdominal cavity, just to the rear of the kidneys. Certain parts of the anatomy suggest that at one time, the ancestors of cetaceans may have had a normal descended testes, external to the body. This internal position is referred to as "testicond".
<P>
The absence of a scrotum is certainly an advantage in streamlining the body. But the position inside the body may also be connected to the fact that average body temperature is fairly low. It averages about 35.5 degrees Celsius. This is similar to the body temperature of other testicond mammals, where the body temperature varies between 33.0 and 35.0C. (The elephant has the highest at 36.5C). The average body temperature of non-testicond mammals is 38.0C. The critical temperature for producing sperm is estimated at about 38.0C, so there is obviously no danger with the internal position when the body temperature is kept fairly low.
<P>
In the largest cetacean, the blue whale, the testes may be 45cm long and weigh 45kg each. 
There appears to be an annual cycle of sperm production. This is thought to possibly be triggered by an increase in day length. Many species show a definite season during which the male is producing sperm. The average sperm length of the humpback whale is 52 microns, the sperm whale 40 microns, and those of the common porpoise average 73 microns, against 55 microns for human sperm.
<P>
The vas deferentia (sperm tubes, so to speak) go back from the testes and combine separately with the urethra. It has been noted that these ducts are highly convoluted, ranging from spiral valves in the blue whale to simple folds in the pygmy sperm whale. With one exception, all terrestrial testicond mammals have highly convoluted ducts. It has been suggested that the shortness of the tubes (due to the internal position of the testes) may be made up for by the convolutions.
<P>
The only accessory genital gland is the prostate, which surrounds the urogenital canal. This gland is surrounded by a thick layer of muscle tissue, called the compressor prostate. This gland secretes the additional fluids which mix with the sperm.

<U>Penis</U>
<P>
The cetacean penis originates in two parts from the rear part of the pelvic bones, or in some, from the entire surface of these bones. The two arms fuse into a very long and thin, hard rope like body which is round or oval in cross-section. In large rorquals, it can be up to three metres long and be 30 cm in diameter. From the pelvic region the penis runs forward within connective tissue to the penis slit, just to the rear of the umbilicus (belly-button). This slit runs back to a point of about one-third the length of the penis measured from the tip. At this point the skin folds forward and covers the end third of the penis, to which it is firmly attached. This third of the penis, which is covered with ordinary skin and runs smoothly to a point, is called the terminal cone. It may be compared with the so-called "glans penis" of many terrestrial mammals, although there is no swelling in this region. When the penis is extended, this fold of skin (called the penis sac) is stretched along the middle part of the penis. Thus the animal can protrude approximately two-thirds of its penis from the penis slit.
<P> 
Just to the rear of the terminal cone, the retracted penis shows (depending on the stage of retraction) a curve, varying from an S-shaped loop to a 360 degree circle. Because during erection the tough skin permits only a little, if any, stretching, this curve enables the animal to protrude the organ. A flat "retractor penis" muscle runs from just above the terminal cone to the rectal wall. This muscle is found only in species in which the penis is fixed to the abdominal wall, such as ungulates, carnivores, and the guinea pig. Although its presence is not always connected with a "fibro-elastic" penis, it is usually better developed in species with such a penis.
<P>
The muscle is not necessarily essential in the retraction of the penis, as studies have shown that the curve may naturally recur. The probable function is to act as a "brake" during erection. The penis consists of three layers, those being an outer layer of thick, tough skin, a layer of connective tissue, and a rather insignificant core of elastic fibers. The urogenital canal is located on the lower side of the penis, within the connective tissue. During erection the inner layer fills with blood, but as mentioned this produces no noticeable swelling.
<P>
It is suggested that the fibroelastic type coitus should be very rapid, with little or no friction movements. In general, this is true. In cattle, deer, antelope, sheep, goats, giraffes and okapis coitus varies from 2 to 5 seconds. However, in camels and llamas it may last up to 10 minutes. The quickest coitus in animals with a vascular penis is found in horses (30 seconds to 3 minutes) and cats (1 min). Most other species of this type last from 3 minutes to more than an hour. Cetaceans, however, do execute quick coitus, averaging from 10 to 30 seconds.
