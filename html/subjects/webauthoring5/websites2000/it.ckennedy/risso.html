These dolphins are known for their scarred skin, which is quite common among many toothed whales. What causes these characteristic scars? Scientists believe that they are the visible end result of aggressive interactions and mating behavior. Some animals, usually the oldest, are completely white. Another striking feature of the Risso's Dolphin is its bulging forehead or melon, which plays a vital role in this cetacean's ability to echolocate. With a blunt head and no beak, this dolphin can often be recognized in the wild by its squarish profile. 
<P>
The Risso's Dolphin is about 4-5 feet long at birth. At full maturity, both the male and female memebers of the species will reach 8-9 feet and weigh between 880-1,100 pounds. Their diet consists largely of squid and some fish. Risso's Dolphins typically travel in small pods of a dozen members or less, but they have also been seen in large pods numbering in the thousands, often with other dolphin species. These animals can live up to 30 years in the wild.
