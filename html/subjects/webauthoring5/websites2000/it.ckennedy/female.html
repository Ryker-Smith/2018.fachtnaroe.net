<U>Ovaries</U>
<P>
The ovaries are located in roughly the same place as the male testes, and are more or less spherical, with a fairly smooth surface, in the resting condition. Immature ovaries are flat and elongated, with a number of grooves on the surface. In the adult, however, they resemble a "bunch of grapes". The "grapes" are protruding follicles in various stages of development. The average weight of the ovary in non-pregnant blue whale is 8 kg. During pregnancy this can increase to a maximum weight of almost 30 kg.
<P>
It has been considered that the ovulation in cetaceans may be spontaneous, rather than based on a cycle. One reason is that a number of fin whales apparently have been observed to ovulate in Antarctic waters during a period in which most males were not in heat. Again, increase in activity is thought to be induced by an increase in day length. Due to migration, fin whales experience increasing day lengths twice a year, once during migration to the equator in fall, and once during migration to the poles in spring. During migration to the equator, the increase in length of day would probably start the cycle. During the migration to the poles, most females are either pregnant or lactating, which inhibits ovulation.
<P>
Many cetaceans seem to ovulate and can become pregnant again immediately after giving birth, although in some lactation seems to prevent this. It appears the female has only one 'period' per year, although she may experience more if the first ovulation is not followed by pregnancy. 
It is generally believed that the Cetacean retains reproductive ability until death, however some studies have shown this may not be so. Some species have been found to show regression in parts of the ovary, mammary glands and uterus. Thus, they may experience "menopause". 
The "Tuba Fallopii" (Fallopian Tubes) are more or less convoluted, and become quite wide and funnel-shaped. 
<P>
<U>Uterus-Vagina</U>
<P>
The uterus is divided into two main uteri called cornua. They run forward, then turn to the side. The ends may be bent slightly to the rear. These contain the uterine glands, and a well-muscled connective tissue containing many blood vessels. During pregnancy this internal layer thickens, and the muscles suggests a peristalic contraction of the uterus is used during labour to expel the young.
<P>
The part of the cervix protruding into the vagina is of different lengths in different species. In the narwhal, bottlenose whale and sperm whale it is quite short, however in the common porpoise it is comparatively long. 
The inner part of the vagina has from four to twelve circular folds, which are very well developed and give the appearance of a chain of successive funnels. The function of the folds, found in no other mammal, is not understood. The inner part is largely glandular. Vaginal smears taken at various stages from 114 common dolphins showed a fairly standard pattern, with a few individual differences. Some individuals showed a substance consisting largely of sulphates, which prevents fertilisation. This has been found by other scientists. It was found in roughly 4.5% of 221 animals caught in the Black Sea. This abnormality is not understood.
<P>
The vulva is a slit like aperture with labia majora and minora (inner and outer folds, or "lips"). The front end of vulva shows a strand of tough, fibrous tissue, from which protrudes the clitoris. Many immature animals also show a band of fibrous tissue running from the front to the rear of the opening, placed so that it is likely to be ruptured during intercourse.
<P>
The mammary glands are two elongated, narrow and flat organs on either side of the vagina. The nipples are located in slits, and extend during suckling. In some embryos eight rudimentary nipples were found, suggesting ancestors may have had four pairs of nipples, and possibly produced multiple young.
