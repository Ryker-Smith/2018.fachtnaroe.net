<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#008000"><P>An investigation into certain past cases of environmental violation showed a case in the vicinity of Clonmel- a town on the footholds of the Nire Valley. This case is briefly stated below: </P>
<P>The owner of a farm, whose land was situated near a Pharmaceutical plant near Clonmel, reported animal and human health problems on his property in the early 1980’s. Investigation carried out by various agencies did not establish a clear connection between emissions from the factory and the effects on the farm. Subsequently, the farmer sought damages in court against owners of the plant. The case was rejected by the High Court but subsequently won an appeal in the Supreme Court and the damages were paid to the farmer. Emissions were implicated in the health problems on the farm.</FONT></TD>
