<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#008000"><P>The importance of environment in today’s world can not be underestimated. Any person who lives in rural or semi-urban Ireland understands what it means to breathe fresh air or to look at miles and miles of greenery around them: at the thirty shades of green of this lovely island. The same person, if he goes to a large, industrial and over-populated town would realize that environment cannot be taken as granted, and has to be literally, guarded preciously. I as such, live amidst the lovely Nire valley: its lakes and hills, the forests and walks and its distinct species like rabbit and deer. I also understand that our present choice, both as a society and as an individual, determine the quality of the environment that we will hand on to our future generations. </FONT><A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ei.html">Click here for world factbook overview of the geography and economy of Ireland.</A> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#008000"><P>In a wider context, it has now become understood that globally certain emissions to the atmosphere are leading to fundamental changes in its composition. It is apparent that these, in turn, are giving rise to changes in the global climate, with impacts including sea level rise, more frequent storms, and erosion of vulnerable coasts. Emissions to air is a major focus now, as international commitments are on reduction of emission of Greenhouse gases, mainly carbon-di-oxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. These gases are implicated in the enhanced Greenhouse effect giving rise to climatic changes. Ireland’s international commitment is to limit greenhouse gas emission in the period 2000 –2012 to 13% above 1990 levels. A process of major change must get underway urgently, if Ireland has to fulfil its obligation. As industries contribution to the emission of gases is considerable I feel that industries in Ireland can contribute considerably towards environment protection</FONT>. </DIR>
