<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#008000"><P>After a long period of decline caused by high emigration, Ireland’s population reached the lowest census figure on record, 2.82 million, in 1961. By 1996, however, the population has risen by almost 29%, reaching 3.63 millionth detailed population growth over the years can be obtained from the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.cso.ie/principalstats/prista2.html">CSO figures</A><FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#008000">. The increased population has contributed largely towards environmental changes.</P>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#008000"><P>New housing completions had more than doubled and the number private of households has increased substantially. Between 1991 and 1996 the number of private households increased by 94,154 or 9.1%. There has been a significant increase in the housing stock also. Completions of new houses in Ireland in 1998 reached 42,349, an increase of 9% over 1997. (Appendix-2). House building has doubled since 1993 to what is the highest rate in Europe relative to population. The increased housing has given rise to increased demand for land and other pressures on environment. The current housing scenario along with the increased housing prices is discussed in detail in an article published </FONT><A HREF="http://www.icsh.ie/housing/view.html">by Irish Council for Social Housing.</A> </P>
