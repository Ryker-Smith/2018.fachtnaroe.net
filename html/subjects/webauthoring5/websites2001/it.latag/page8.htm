<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#008000"><P>I suggest that industries could go a long way in preserving the environment we live in, by taking the following steps -:</P>
<P>1.All existing legislation in place in a given area for environmental protection should be adhered to by all the existing industries in that area. Environmental legislation exist in all areas specified below –</P>
<P>Water</P>
<P>Air</P>
<P>Waste</P>
<P>Environmental Protection &amp; Information</P>
<P>Planning &amp;Building</P>
<P>Noise Nuisance</P>
<P>Trees &amp;Wildlife</P>
<P>2. There are Acts established by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland which control industrial activities involving radioactive substances, devices and irradiating apparatus. All these acts should be adhered to by industries and licenses taken whenever required.</P>
<P>3.Forests can make an important contribution to environmental quality. All industries in forest areas should be encouraged to plant trees in their vicinity, especially where initial deforestation had taken place to set up industrial establishment.</P>
<P>4. As per license requirements, a person responsible for implementation of all Government licenses should be clearly named in an industry.</P>
<P>5.All industries should encourage recycling of materials being used in the premises. This would help to protect the environment as well save the loss to the economy of all the valuable materials that are presently being dumped</P>
<P>6.The packaging materials used should be environmentally friendly in keeping with The ‘Green Dot’ requirements. </P>
<P>Sectors like industry will need to integrate environment considerations fully into policy and decision making. This can also be advantageous for the business itself by ensuring that Irish products and services match the growing international sentiment of favouring goods that are environment friendly.</FONT></TD>
