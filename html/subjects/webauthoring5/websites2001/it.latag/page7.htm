<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#008000"><P>It is clear now that the quality of the environment, the quality of life and economic progress, are inter-linked and inter-dependent. There is a two-way relationship between society and the environment –the environment is on loan to society to sustain and develop its quality of life while in turn society is the caretaker of the environment for future generations. Economic activities use two primary production factors: labour and nature. Nature is used in terms of raw material, energy, water and air, and in terms of its capacity to assimilate residuals. Such uses of nature can put the environment under pressure. In recent years there is recognition that policies are required that focus on environment degradation. Industries, as such, being the user of nature in a big way, needs to integrate environment considerations fully into policy and decision making.</P>
<P>Human influence on the environment once transitory and local has grown steadily particularly with the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Because of this, need is not only to concentrate on the environment itself, but also on society’s influence on the environment. Therefore society’s role in environment protection, beginning with the role of an individual and the industry as a whole, is crucial for the protection of our environment. Given this I suggest that small individual actions and combined industrial actions could go a long way in preserving the environment we live in. </P>
