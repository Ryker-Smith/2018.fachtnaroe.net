<FONT FACE="Balloon Bd BT" SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Meshing '60s-styled guitar-pop with an understated '80s dance beat, The Stone Roses defined the British guitar-pop scene of the late '80s and early '90s. After their eponymous 1989 debut album became an British sensation, countless other groups in the same vein became popular, including the Charlatans, Inspiral Carpets, and Happy Mondays. However, the band was never able to capitalize on the promise of their first album, waiting five years before they released their second record and slowly disintegrating in the year and half after its release. </P>
