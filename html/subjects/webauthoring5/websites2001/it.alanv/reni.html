<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Reni replaced Simon Wolstencroft on drums for the band’s 1985 Swedish gigs. Generally acknowledged as the member with the most musical talent, he was a multi instrumentalist able to play guitar &amp; bass as well as drums. Reni’s first song writing credit would not come until 1994’s "Daybreak" and discontent with this was believed to be a contributing factor in his departure in April of 1995. Reni has not been interviewed since his departure and it is unknown whether or not he will return to the music business.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Currently believed to be putting together a band, which may feature him as guitarist/vocalist/songwriter. His last recorded output was playing on the "Ten Storey Love Song" single B-sides "Moses" and "Ride On". Contrary to popular belief he did not play drums on Ian Brown’s "Can’t See Me" single.</LI></P>
