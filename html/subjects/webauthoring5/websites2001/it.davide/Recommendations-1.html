</B><P>When we were told that we had to do a report on anything within reason for our Communications Module, I don’t think I had any hesitation in choosing ‘Traffic and Parking Problems in Tipperary Town’. I felt it was a very important issue that needed to be concentrated on. I would like to make the following recommendations on the report I have written.</P>
<P> </P>

<OL>

<LI>It is advised that the proposed by-pass for Tipperary Town be accepted and welcomed by everyone in the town, as a way of easing the congestion which currently exists in town.</LI>

<LI>It is recommended that those people whose livelihood will be disrupted by the building of this by-pass be financially compensated for the loss of their homes, or land, or farm livestock also.</LI>

<LI>We advise that the local authorities put in motion a plan to remove the remaining cattle mart in the town, to a location more suitable outside of town altogether, so that this would help the movement of traffic in the town as a whole.</LI>

<LI>We recommend that the U.D.C. try and provide more car parks, so as to give more accommodation to motorists and ease traffic build-up in the Main Street area.   </LI>

<LI>It is advised that the local authorities try a system of a one-way street for a longer period of time than has already been tried.</LI></OL>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I hope that these recommendations that I have listed above seem reasonable. I think that the local authorities have their own ideas with regard to the problem. Maybe some of the ideas suggested above might be similar to those of the U.D.C. and that in the long run everyone will benefit from the new by-pass. Anything that is suggested would be of help when tackling the problem of traffic in our town.</P>
