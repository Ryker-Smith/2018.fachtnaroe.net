</B><P>At present there are ten car parks in the town. In total these car parks provide space for 525 vehicles and they are located throughout the town. Of these ten, six of these are public and four are private. There was a survey carried out in the town, which established the occupancy levels in these car parks at different times throughout the day. It was found that the car park at James Street was the only one, which was operating at optimum level throughout the day. This is a public car park. Another public car park was The Market Yard car park, which, on the day this survey was taken was full to capacity, so therefore there were no vacant car spaces. The highest occupancy time when all spaces were full was at 4 p.m. in the afternoon. The highest occupancy rate for private car parks was at 12 noon, when 53 per cent of all spaces were used leaving 85 spaces free. The Council hopes to carry out further surveys to determine what the reasons are for such low usage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Council have introduced a new scheme for another of its’ public car parks, this time at Abbey Street. This new law is already in force since Tuesday, 24<SUP>th</SUP> October 2000. If a vehicle is occupying a space for up to 2 hours there is no charge. If the vehicle is there for up to 3 hours, then there is a charge of 30p and for 4 hours the charge is 60p. The maximum stay in any one-day is 4 hours. I have a copy of these laws in <B>(Appendix1).</B> A person using the car park will be required to purchase a ticket and display it on his or her own vehicle, for the length of time their vehicle is occupying a space there. It is not permitted to park trucks there or to sell food from mobile vans either.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Council has had a lot of problems in the past with on-street parking. There is one particular street where if cars were parked on either side of the street, it was really difficult for other vehicles to pass up and down. The Council tried a system of one-way traffic for this street, however the system proved to be a failure and was abolished after about three months in operation. The name of the street in question was Michael Street and it is just of the Main Street of the town. It was being considered that to facilitate through traffic, it was necessary to give precedence to traffic movement over parking requirements along Main Street. A complete banning of parking along one side of the Main Street would immediately increase the traffic flow capacity of the street. This would greatly benefit everyone in the town.</P>
