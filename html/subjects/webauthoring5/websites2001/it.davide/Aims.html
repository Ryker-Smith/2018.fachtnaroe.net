</B></FONT><P>When I first decided what I was going to write my project on, I was unclear as to whether or not to choose this particular topic. I am glad I did, because, it is an issue that definitely needs to be tackled and it is a thorn in the side of many people in Tipperary Town. My aim is to further highlight the problem. It seems the problem is going to get worse before it gets better. However, the Local Authority realises it needs urgent attention and is deciding, as I write this on a final route to choose as a by-pass. I want people to be more aware of the problem if that is possible.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I would like to think that the project gives a clear insight into the problem, it is my aim to present this report in a clear and understanding way, so that people would be able to follow it easily. My aim in this report is also to show that I have done some research into the topic that I have chosen. I know that the problem is being dealt with and that a decision is expected sometime in the year 2001, let us hope that this is the case. I would like to show that I have a good idea about the problem and therefore, I am able to write about the problem with first hand experience, because I am a motorist and have to drive in the town most days, plus the fact I am from the town. This is another aim I have for the project. Overall I would hope that my project is understood clearly and that I have given a clear picture of my findings of the traffic in Tipperary. I think this would be my overall aim for this project. </P>
