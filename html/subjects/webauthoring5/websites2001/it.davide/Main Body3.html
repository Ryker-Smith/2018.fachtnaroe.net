</FONT><FONT SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">BY-PASS ROUTE PROPOSAL</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">There has been a need of a by-pass for Tipperary Town for a while now. Tipperary (SR) County Council identified this back in the early 1990’s. There are in total eight routes being considered for the proposed by-pass. Four of these are located on the southern side of the town, while the other four are located on the northern side. While this news has to be welcomed, it has to be taken into consideration that this by-pass will be built at the cost of the local environment. It would definitely be of benefit to the Main Street, as it would mean that trucks and other large transport vehicles would no longer clog up the town’s main street.</P>
<P>I am sure this will be welcome news to everyone connected to the town, from business people, pedestrians and road users themselves. When it is finally decided what route will be chosen, it will mean that when the diggers and JCBS’ start to turn on their engines, it will mean a lot of upheaval and stress for those residents whose land and homes will be affected by this. However, these people will be compensated for their losses’ financially. With such a big undertaking as this there are bound to be drawbacks, but in the long term it is hoped that everyone in the hinterland of the town will feel the benefits.</P>
<P>It has been stated that when work is ready to commence on the by-pass, it will take up to four maybe five years before it is completed. As I have said already this could come at the cost to the local environment. An Environmental Impact Study is due to be carried out on the proposed routes. A number of factors are to be considered when this study takes place, these are, Human Beings, Flora and Fauna, the Soil and Geology, Water, Air, Climate, Material Assets and Cultural Heritage. As can be seen, there are a number of issues, which have to be dealt with and considered before any final plans are made.</P>
<P>It may be that some of the drawn out plans may need to be changed slightly. Also while this survey is being carried out, more investigations will continue to be held by staff at Tramore Regional Design House, who along with Tipperary (SR) County Council will have to decide where and when this by-pass actually is going to be built. A copy of these plans can be found in <B>(Appendix 2).</P>
