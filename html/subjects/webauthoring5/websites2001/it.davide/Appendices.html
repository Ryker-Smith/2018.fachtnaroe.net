</B></FONT><P>While I was preparing my report, I had to gather some research from various sources. I received some information from the library and also from the local U.D.C. office. I referred to these places in parts of my report. On page five of the report in the second paragraph, I have referred to the new parking arrangements for the Abbey Street car park. This is to show evidence that I carried out some research for the report. I have included this evidence as Appendices 1.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On page six I have included a plan of the proposed new by-pass for the town. This plan shows the routes chosen by the authorities involved and it can be found on the last paragraph on page six, it is shown as Appendices 2. These are the only two pieces of document to be included in my Appendices. They can be found attached to this page. I would just like to thank the people whom I received this information from.  </P>
