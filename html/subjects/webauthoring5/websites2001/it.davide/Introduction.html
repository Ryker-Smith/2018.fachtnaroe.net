<P>I have decided to do my assignment on traffic problems and parking facilities in Tipperary Town. This has been a thorny issue with people of the locality for a while now and is a problem that if is ignored will just go away it won’t. I feel that it is an issue that needs to be dealt with and I feel that it is an interesting topic to do your assignment on. Because Tipperary town is stuck in the middle of the N24, on the main road between Waterford City and Limerick City, it is to be expected then, that as long as there is cars, trucks and other forms of transport using the road then the problem will always be there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The main source I used in gathering my information was the local library in Tipperary. They provided me with information on where to look when researching my project. I also went to my local U.D.C. office and they were also of benefit to me. I spent time in the library reading up on the subject and found out a lot about my chosen topic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have to say and not in a shy way, that, most of the work was done by myself. However, I did receive help from the people working at my local library and also at the U.D.C. office. My sister also gave me a hand now and then and I would like to acknowledge this.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As I have already stated my main sources of information have been the local library and U.D.C. office. I also received a copy of the proposed new by-pass for the town from a relative of mine and these really have been the only sources I have used for this assignment. </P>
