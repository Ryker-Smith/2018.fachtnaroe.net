</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, as a motorist have noticed that there is a problem with the traffic problem in town. At times it can be very bad, for instance on a Friday the traffic would remind you of a capital city it was so bad and that is no exaggeration. One of the reasons for this is because of the local marts, which used to be held in the town. However in the last two months, one of these marts has been sold to allow for a new supermarket to open up. It must be applauded that this supermarket will provide a multi-storey car park, which will be welcome news for a lot of people in the town.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of its’ location, Tipperary Town is at the intersection of the N24 Limerick to Waterford route, and the N74 to Cashel. The traffic congestion in the town has for some time been of major concern to both the UDC and Tipperary South Riding County Council. As the level of traffic increases all the time along the N24 route and also the N74, which run through the town, so also does the level of traffic which passes along the Main Street of the town of Tipperary. It is a problem for both motorists and pedestrians alike. Much of the traffic, which travels along the Main Street, is through traffic (over 40 per cent). This is information I received from my local library, which let me read a copy of the Urban District Council report on traffic and parking in the town.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason that much of the traffic along the Main Street is through traffic, is the fact that the street forms part of both the N74 and the N24. Every day these two routes carry large volumes of traffic between Limerick, Clonmel, Cahir, Cashel and Waterford. A lot of this traffic is forced to go through the centre of Tipperary Town. So as you can see from this there is going to have to be something done to solve this problem in the town.  </P>
