On Thursday it was realized that all lines of communication between headquarters and the other positions were finally cut. Connolly on reconnaissance in the streets around the GPO, now hardly defendable, was shot twice in the leg and in various Volunteers emplacements the talk was of evacuation, if not actual surrender. Brugha was seriously wounded in an attack on the South Dublin Union but by sheer ferocity he and the other defenders beat the British back.
