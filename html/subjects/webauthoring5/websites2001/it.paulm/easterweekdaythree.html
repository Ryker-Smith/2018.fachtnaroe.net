Wednesday say the first Republican surrender when Heuston had to evacuate the Mendicity Institute which was nearest to Lowe's central chain of firepower. MacDonagh's men in Jacob's were holding out with few casualties but Ceannt in the South Dublin Union was under continuous fierce attack. The British heavy firepower was greatly improved by the fitting out of a boat, the Helga (Seen Below), as an artillery platform.

She continued to pound the city center until Sackville Street was reduced to rubble and the gold lettering on the flag above the beleaguered GPO had turned dark brown.

Yet it was on the same day that the Volunteers had their most impressive military success. Reinforcements had arrived at Kingstown in the shape of two companies of the Sherwood Foresters. They were welcomed by the majority of Dubliners as saviors but consisted of new recruits, most of whom had been in the army for less than three months. As they marched along Norththumberland Road towards Mount Street Bridge to cross the Grand Canal they were caught from de Valera's outpost. It tool many hours for them to force their wasy across the canal and at the cost of four officers killed and fourteen wounded and 216 ORs killed or seriously injured.

The total number of Volunteers in the engagement was put as two in a house in Haddington Road, one of which was killed (Lieutenant Michael Malone), three in Norththumberland Road and seven in Clanwilliam House on Mount Street, three of which died.
