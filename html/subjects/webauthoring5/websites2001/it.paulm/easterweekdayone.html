The number who turned out was about 1,500, consisting of Volunteers, Citizen Army, Cumann na mBan, and Fianna Eireann (the National Boy Scouts). The majority (including Pearse, Connolly, Macdermott and Plunkett) occupied the GPO in Sackville Street (Now O'Connoll Street ) as Headquarters.
Edward Daly was in command of the Four Courts in the Church Street - North King Street area; Sean Heuston took the Mendicity Institute across the Liffey on Usher's Island; MacDonagh took over Jacob's biscuit factory in Bishop Street near St Stephen's Green; Boland's Bakery and flour mill were taken by deValera and he set up outposts on the railway between Westland Row and Lansdowne Road at Mount Street Bridge on the Grand Canal; Ceannt with Cathal Brugha took over the South Dublin Union with deployments at Marrowbone Lane, Ardee Street and Cork Street; Sean Connolly, one of the first casualties, and a company of Citizen Army members occupied the City Hall.

The emplacements formed a rough ring around the GPO headquarters and were placed near some of the British barracks. The original strategy was devised by Plunkett, now very ill, and Connolly, and seemed to consist of holding out until spontaneous risings west of the Shannon would seize most of Munster and Connacht and personnel then march on the capital. Without the promised arms form Germany and given the welter of command and counter-command this could not happen. Clarke, however, belived that they could withstand counterattack for months, by which time the war would surely be over and the IRB have its place at a post-war conference table. The total number of British troops in the city was about 1,200, but reinforcements were soon on their way from Belfast, the Curragh, Templemore and Athlone.

The first incident occurred in Phoenix Park when a body of Volunteers, having set out even before the reading of the Proclamation, failed to blow up the arms dump at the Magazine Fort. The first casualty was the Seventeen-year-old son of the fort's commander who was shot as he tried to reach a telephone to raise the alarm. The unarmed DMP sergent on duty at the outer gate of the castle was another early casualty but the full bitterness of what any violent rising may mean was not understood until four o'clock when a band of Irish Volunteers Defence Corps, a middle - aged group of Irishmen forming a reserve group of the British Army, were attacked as they were ambushed after a route march. These, known locally as the Gorgeous Wrecks, were raked with bullets. Five dead and nine wounded.

The first tactical manoeuvre was made by Mallin and Markievicz when they realised that St Stephen's Green was vulnerable to fire from the Shelbourne Hotel on the north side and that their digging of trenches had been a waste of effort. They took over the Royal College of Surgeons on the west side but were driven out by reinforced British fire on the next afternoon. The only serious activity from the GPO headquarters was the shooting of four Lancers in Sackville Street on that Monday afternoon. Pearse read out the proclamation at 12.45

By the coming of night in what had been a fine sunny spring day the crowds from Fairyhouse races and other Bank Holiday treats returned to a terribly changed Dublin. The death toll included civilians as well as volunteers, police and soldiers.
