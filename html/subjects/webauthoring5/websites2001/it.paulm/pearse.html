He had been editor of <I>An Claidheamh Soluis(1903-1909)</I> and had already begun in his writings to walk of a cleansing blood sacrifice which would restore the quick heart of Irish nationalism. He was commander-in-chief of the forces in the Rising, president of the provisional goverment, part-author with Connolly and MacDonagh of the Proclamation which he read to a largely uninterested Dublin audience on Easter Monday and the person who agreed to unconditional surrender on Saterday 29 April 1916. He was the first to be executed four days later.
