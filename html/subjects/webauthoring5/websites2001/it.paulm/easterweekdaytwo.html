Day Two

By Tuesday General Lowe had declared martial law in Dublin city and county, having now 5,000 troops at his disposal. His strategy was to keep an unbreachable line of troops along an east-west axis that would separate the posts on the north side of the Liffey, including the GPO headquarters, from the rest. He soon recovered control of a line between Kingsbridge Station and Trinity. He also had four pieces of artillery which came from Athlone and were set up near Prussia Street and in Phibsborough above the Cabra Road. It was typical of the informal nature of the affair that a private in the Dublin Fusiliers could stop a volunteer friend in Dorset Street to warn him that the guns were on the way and to get the message to the GPO.

It did increase the anger of the populace.

That day the Citizen Army battalion came under such fire from the Shelbourne and the United Services Club that they were forced to abandon their positions in the College of Surgeons.

One other event of that Tuesday has lived in infamy; a Captain of the Royal Irish Rifles called Bowen-Colthurst arrested two journalists, Patrick McIntyre and Thomas Dickson and the well-known pacifist Francis Sheehy-Skeffington. None had had anything to do with the Rising, though Sheehy-Skeffington was trying to organize a citizens' band to prevent looting and his wife Hanna was a messenger In the GPO. The next morning on his own initiative Bowen-Colthurst had them shot, the bungled operation required two firing-squads.
