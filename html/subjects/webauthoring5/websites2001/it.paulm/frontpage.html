The Easter Rising, which lasted for five days at the end of April 1916 and made Pearse and Connolly household names, is probable the single most important event in the history of modern Ireland.

Attitudes to it have ranged from acclamation to execration. It seemed to end up in abject failure with its participants jeered and spat upon by their compatriots, yet within weeks it was realised that it purpose had been attained: a sprit of reveloution had been kindled in a quiescent country.
