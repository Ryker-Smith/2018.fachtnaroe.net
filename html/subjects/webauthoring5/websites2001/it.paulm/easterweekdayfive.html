Birrell returned on the Friday accompanying General Sir john Maxwell, who was to take over as Commander-in-Charge. Maxwell was to say rashly to Lord Wimbourne, the Lord Lieutenant, 'I am going to ensure that there will be no more treason whispered for a hundred years.' His first announcement on arrival was: 'If necessary I shall not hesitate to destroy all buildings within any area occupied by the rebels.' This was indicative of the wisdom and delicacy with which he would handle the aftermath of surrender. He and Lowe had now 20,000 British troops deployed and the city center was cordoned off. It was a attrition with shellfire growing more and more accurate, streets raked with machine-gun bullets, and charging and dismantling of barricades the main military activity.

Pearse had issued another communiqué at 9:30a.m. reassuring those who had fought that they had 'redeemed Dublin from many shames, and made her name splendid among the names of cities.' He then dismissed the women and girls, shaking hands with each as they left. By evening the GPO was on fire and the Cumann na mBan members who where still on duty and wounded were moved back to Jarvis Street Hospital. The remaining Volunteers decided to make a dash through Moore Street to Great Britian Street but they did not know that Henry Street was continuously under British fire mainly from Rotunda. The O'Rahilly volunteered to reconnoiter Henry Street to see if it was worth trying to reach Moore Street. Before he left he made sure that thirteen prisoners who had been held in the GPO were safe before heading out. He was shot in Moore Lane. He was one of the men whom Yeats remembered with typical affection. He had delivered MacNeill's orders to Kerry and Limerick but headed for Dublin himself, and in the balled 'The O'Rahilly' Yeats has him say to Pearse and Connolly:

There was to be one other operation on that Friday which has become part of mythology. Thomas Ashe, with Richard Mulcahy (Who took command of the Free State forces after the death of Michael Collins in August 1922)as Lieutenant, engaged a force of the paramilitary RIC at Ashbourne. A party of forty RIC men led by a chief inspector were on their way to relieve the barracks at Ashbourne and they were effectively ambushed at a crossroads about a mile north of the town. The fight lasted for five hours and when the police ran out of ammunition they surrendered. Eight had been killed and fifteen wounded. Ashs's company had up till then moved freely about the county attacking barracks and doing what they could to disrupt communications. Ashe's died in Mountjoy Prision in 1917 from pneumonia brought on by force feeding during his hungry strike.
