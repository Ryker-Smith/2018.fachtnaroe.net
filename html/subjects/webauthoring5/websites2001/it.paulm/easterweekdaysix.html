The Rising was effectively finished and by the Saturday morning the decision to seek terms from Lowe had been made. It is said that it was the shooting of a publican and his family while running out of one of the houses carrying a white flag that persuaded Pearse that it was time to call a halt.
<P>
A Cumann na mBan nurse, Elizabeth O'Farrell, carried a white flag and this messge to the British barricade at Great Britain Street:

Lowe demanded an unconditional surrender and at 3:30.p.m. Pearse, wearing a grearcoat and a Boer War slouch hat handed his sword to Lowe.
<P>
At 3:45 he signed the typed order of stand-down:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In order to prevent the further slaughter
Dublin citizens, and in the hope of
Saving the lives of our followers now
surrounded and hopelessly outnumbered,
the members of the Provisional Government
present at Headquarters have agreed
to unconditional surrender, and the Commandant
of the various districts in the
City and County will order their
Commands to lay down their arms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The order had to be countersigned by Connolly since the Citizen Army recognized no leader but him:

I agree to these conditions for the men
Only under my command in Moore

Then they were made to lie on the grass in the Rotunda grounds. Later that evening a British officer called Lee Wilson amused himself by stripping Clarke naked and parading him in view of the nurses who were looking out the windows of the hospital. Clarke, in his sixtieth year, was by the standards of the time an elderly man and it was particularly cruel thing to do to a person of known prudery. Watching the humiliation was Michael Collins, who was able to announce five years later: 'We got him [Lee Wilson] today in Gorey.'
<P>MacDonagh, with most of his force intact, refused to accept the order until he had spoken to Pearse. His addition to Pearse's order read:

On consultation with Commandant
Ceannt and other officers I have decided
To agree to unconditional surrender also.

The greatest difficulty was experienced by de Valera at the garrison at Boland's mills. The defences had not been breached - unlike most of the other emplacements it was a tactical building - and the men were prepared for a much longer siege. When they did obey the order, many broke their rifles in dismay on the ground.
<P>
As such things go the casualties were light: of the volunteers sixty-four dead excluding those who would later be executed; 134 soldiers wounded; seventeen policemen from the DMP and the RIC. It was the civilians who suffered most with at least 220 killed and wounded in excess of 600. The center of the city was rubble and indeed in the rough ellipse formed by the Circular Road many buildings were damaged. The fury of the populace was vented early.
