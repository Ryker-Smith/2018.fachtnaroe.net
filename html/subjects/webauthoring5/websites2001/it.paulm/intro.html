And I say to my people's masters: Beware,<BR>
Beware of the thing that is coming, beware of the risen people,<BR>
Who shall take what ye would not give. Did ye think to conquer the people,<BR>
Or that Law is stronger than life and than man's desire to be free?<BR>
We will try it out with you, ye that have harried and held,<BR>
Ye that have bullied and bribed, ....... tyrants, hypocrites, liars!<BR>
