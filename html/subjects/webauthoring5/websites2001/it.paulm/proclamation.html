___________________________<br>
<font size="4">THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT<br>
OF THE <br>
</font><font size="5"><b>IRISH REPUBLIC</b> <br>
</font><font size="4">TO THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND</font> </p>

<p>IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN: In the name of God and
of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition
of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her
flag and strikes for her freedom.</p>

<p>Having organised and trained her manhood
through her secret revolutionary organisation, the Irish
Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military
organisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army,
having patiently perfected her discipline, having resolutely
waited for the right moment to reveal itself, she now seizes that
moment, and, supported by her exiled children in America and by
gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own
strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.</p>

<p>We declare the right of the people of Ireland
to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of
Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long
usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has
not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished
except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every
generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national
freedom and sovereignty; six times during the last three hundred
years they have asserted it to arms. Standing on that fundamental
right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we
hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent
State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our
comrades-in-arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and
of its exaltation among the nations.</p>

<p>The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby
claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The
Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and
equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve
to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and
all of its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation
equally and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an
alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority
in the past.</p>

<p>Until our arms have brought the opportune
moment for the establishment of a permanent National,
representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the
suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government,
hereby constituted, will administer the civil and military
affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.</p>

<p>We place the cause of the Irish Republic under
the protection of the Most High God. Whose blessing we invoke
upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will
dishonour it by cowardice, in humanity, or rapine. In this
supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline
and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for
the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to
which it is called.</p>
