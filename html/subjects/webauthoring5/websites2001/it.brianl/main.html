<p>A lot of the workers travel to there the compound on special flights.
This are known as the "Janet" airlines, a fleet of unmarked 737-200's.
They reside in a side terminal of Las Vegas' McCarren International Airport.
Each weekday there are from 10 to 20 flights that take workers to and from
Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range, which is also within the restricted area
and is about 60 miles to the northwest of Area 51.

<p><b><u><font size=+2>The Area 51 bus Service</font></u></b></center>

<p>Las Vegas is not the only place Area 51 workers reside. Just about every
small town that rings the Restricted Area has someone who works there,
including Rachel. The workers from the towns east of Rachel take an unmarked
bus into the base every weekday. The bus starts in Alamo where it picks
up the majority of people, then heads to Crystal Springs, where the workers
from Caliente, Panaca and Pioche are picked up. From there the bus travels
over Hancock Summit and down the Groom Lake Road where it crosses the Restricted
Border around 6:45am, Monday through Friday. The bus comes back out of
the Restricted Area at 3:45pm, taking the workers back home.

<p><b><u><font size=+2>The area 51 Guards</font></u></b></center>

<p>Area 51's perimeter is guarded by an anonymous security unit. There
has been a lot of speculation as to who the guards are, some suggest that
the guards are military police, but most suggest that they are from a civilian
security contractor. There was early speculation that they were private
security from the Wakenhaut Corporation. What I have found about the Wakenhaut
Corporation is that they have the security contract for the Nevada Test
Site and that George Wakenhaut himself had always wanted the contract for
Area 51, but could never get it.
