<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000FF">The building that now houses
the South Tipperary Art Centre was built in the 1950’s.It was originally
a bus depot, then it housed the offices of the Clonmel credit Union. When
the Credit Union converted the old Ritz cinema into offices the building
in Nelson Street again became vacant.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000FF">In 1994 the Tipperary S.R.County
Council and the Clonmel Corporation purchased the old Credit Union building
which would be leased to the steering committee, formed earlier that year,
to become the headquarters of the South Tipperary Art Centre.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000FF">The building was totally refurbished
after many months of hard work by both the staff and the Board of Directors.
The Art Centre was formally opened on Friday 19<sup>th</sup> April 1996
by Ms Monica de Bigio (nee Cullen) a Clonmel born opera singer now based
in Italy.</font></font>
