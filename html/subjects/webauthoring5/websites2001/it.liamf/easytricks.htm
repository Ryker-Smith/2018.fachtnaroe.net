<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Here are all the beginner tricks-these tricks should be attempted only after the ollie has been mastered.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">How to do the fakie ollie:</P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To do this you NEED to know how to ollie while moving. The fakie ollie is an ollie in your</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">regular stance but you need to go backwards (this is a very basic trick). All you need to do is pedal</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">backwards, get into the ollie position and do and ollie. It only takes about two tries to</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">accomplish this trick.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">How to do a manual:</P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Put your front foot on the front truck bolts and put your back foot on two of the back bolts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This stance helps to control your board. Now, you need to have a lot of balance and just ride on</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">your board and raise the front of your board so you are just balancing and riding on the back</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">truck.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">How to do the nose manual:</P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the same thing as a normal manual but you raise the back truck up so you are riding on</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">just the front truck</FONT>.</P>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">How to do the ollie manual:</P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to learn the ollie manual, it is painfully obvious that you must learn the ollie, and the</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">manual first. Damn! An ollie manual is the act of ollieing and landing on your two back wheels and </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">balancing on them for a distance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The best way I know to learn this is to pop a tiny ollie, as though you are ollieing over a crack,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and don't level out the board. Land on your back wheels and try to be in the position you are in</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">when you manual when you land.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing I know is that you should not try to learn this in place. Some people learn it moving</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">fast, some people learn it moving rather slowly, but hardly any can successfully learn it standing</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">still. You may need to try fast and slow. Experiment with it and have fun. Don't get pissed off if</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">you don't pull it the first try! Skate Hard.</P>
