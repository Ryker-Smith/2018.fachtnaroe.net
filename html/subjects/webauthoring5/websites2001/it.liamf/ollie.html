<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">THE OLLIE</P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This section will take you step by step through the process of learning how to ollie. So if you are at present a wannabe or just at the very first stages of learning how to skate you've come to the right place.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Now I assume you have mastered the basics on you board, like turning, pushing, stopping etc. since you have moved on to the next step. Now you are going to learn how to ollie, a process which is similar to learning how to walk when you're a baby.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It takes a lot of time and patience and most of all PRACTICE. No matter how many "advice" columns you read on how to ollie, you'll never learn until you have spent time trying to master it. So you think you're ready? Ok...here goes!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. One thing you can do to practice ollieing is called an acid drop, but in layman's terms it means riding off a curb. To do this, you obviously need a curb and you approach it at a medium to fast pace. Then all you have to do is push down on the tail (shift you weight onto the tail so the front truck lifts up) of you board in front of the curb so you are doing a little manual and you'll just ride off the curb. Make sure you keep you weight centered. Then land and keep going while listenting to all the cheers of you pals after witnessing your very first skateboard trick!!!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Ok, now that you are nailing some nice acid drops off curbs all over town, you are ready to ollie. I recommend practicing this either on a thin carpet (much to you parents dismay!) or in a stand still position. Make sure the ball of your back foot is on the center of the tail (straighter pop = more pop). When you crouch just before you jump, swing your arms up as you jump, like a jumping jack. This makes you jump higher, therefore you ollie higher. Make sure your shoulders line up with your board.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Straight line = straight shoulders.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Straight shoulders = straight pop.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Straight pop = better pop.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Better pop = high ollies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then you pop you tail and slide you front foot up the board which is rising vertically in the air. This aforementioned motion is extremely important as it makes the board rise in the air. Next you kind of "kick" out that same front foot so you straighten out the board horizontally in the air. Now you bend your knees and land that sucker! It should look like the board is glued to you feet when you do it properly. It takes a lot of practice to get the movements and timing right, but I promise that once you do it correctly one time, you will know how it feels and it'll be simple from that point on! Congrats, you just learned you second and most important skateboard trick! The ollie is the foundation on which 99% of all other tricks are based.</P>
