<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After you have done this, you should find a very slight slope and step onto the board, one foot at a time. Get the feel of the board as you roll slowly down the hill. Get of the board before you are going too fast. The best way to do this is to step off the board if you are going slowly and jump if you are going quickly. Both these options are risky though so BE CAREFUL!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once you have the hang of skating down a slight slope, take your board onto the flat where you will have to push it with one of your feet. The best option in this situation is to use your "better foot" to push along the ground. In most circumstances this is a skater's back foot. Take a couple of "pushes" then put your foot back on the board and glide. Keep pushing when you loose momentum.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next trick is to "tick-tack". This refers to the skater moving the nose of the board back and forth by applying pressure to the back kick, lifting the nose into the air and moving it with the front foot. The trick here is to learn to balance on the back wheels for that instant while you are moving the nose from side to side, before you touch down. Sounds tricky but isn't. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basically</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1 - apply slight pressure to the kick to get the nose into the air</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2 - move the nose either to the left or the right before bringing it (the nose) back to the ground</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3 - move the nose BACK IN THE OPPOSITE direction before placing it back on the ground</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Continue this process which brings about momentum and speed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have mastered these you are ready to try the ollie!</P>
