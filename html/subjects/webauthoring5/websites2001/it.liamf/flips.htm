</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"><P>This is the simplist trick.</P>
<P>Jump into the air and turn halfway around. Yeah you heard us right. Well... you don't usually do</P>
<P>this trick on it's own. You can add it</P>
<P>on to other tricks to make them more "spiffy". For example: "kickflip body varial" would be a</P>
<P>kickflip with a 180 degree turn of the</P>
<P>body.</P>

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"><P>Put your feet in the standard ollie position, but with your front foot, put only your toes on the</P>
<P>board and put your foot just in front of the back truck bolts. Start the kickflip just as you would</P>
<P>an ollie and drag the front foot straight up the board from it's starting position. When your foot</P>
<P>reaches the concalve, kick it in a downward motion off the edge off the board to allow the deck</P>
<P>to rotate freely. Once the deck has flipped over once, use your back foot to catch the deck. From</P>
<P>here the front foot should be stomped back onto the board while you even out your weight</P>
<P>between both feet. Hit the ground and roll away!</P>

<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">How to do a fakie kickflip:</P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"><P>Lets look at this in stages</P>
<P>1) This trick is just like a normal kickflip, the only difference is you're rolling fakie</P>
<P>2) First learn how to do fakie ollie and kickflip </P>
<P>3) Ride along backward (fakie) and do a fakie ollie</P>
<P>4) As you are doing the ollie, move your foot as you would in a kickflip </P>
<P>&nbsp;5) Catch the board with either foot (advice on whether you should catch this with your front or</P>
<P>back foot depends on which person you talk to) and level out.</P>
<P>6) Be sure to direct your feet to land on the truck bolts. Land and roll away</P>
<P>It must be noted that when a skater lands this trick their weight can be too far forward and the</P>
<P>board will flip out from under them. To avoid this keep your weight evenly between both feet on</P>
<P>landing.</P>
