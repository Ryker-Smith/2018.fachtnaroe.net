<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Glossary of Skateboarding Terms</P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"><P>This page is for those people who just don't get it. They don't understand our language. So, as a public service to all those babyboomers and beginners, here is a page of definitions of skater's terminology. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Backside </P><DIR>

<P>Turns or rotations in the direction your toes point towards, so that your back is facing the outside of the arc. Sometimes abbreviated as 'bs' or 'b/s' </P></DIR>

<P>Bail </P><DIR>

<P>Intentionally landing (hopefully) on one's feet or otherwise to avoid injury in the case of a trick which has not been preformed properly or cannot be landed ("chickening out" etc.). </P></DIR>

<P>Boardslide </P><DIR>

<P>A trick where you lift your front truck over the lip/coping/what-have-you and slide. Also: railslide. </P></DIR>

<P>Fakie </P><DIR>

<P>Riding backwards. We should note here that when riding fakie, your weight is balanced as in your normal stance, whereas switch-stance requires you to adjust your balance to suit a slightly different style of trick. I'd also like to pointout that the distinction between switch-stance and normal is fast disappearing as people now immediately learn to ride both ways. Hopefully, in a few years, goofy-foot and regular foot will no longer exist. </P></DIR>

<P>Gnarly </P><DIR>

<P>Style of skating currently popular and popular in the 80s, involving "big" tricks that require not only skill, but balls of steel also. These might involve ollieing a huge gap, or grinding a 20-30 stair handrail. Tricks are often simple, the opposite of tech. Typical of east coast skaters. (See also: Going big) </P></DIR>

<P>Going Big </P><DIR>

<P>Performing a trick high in the air, covering a large area, or off a high obstacle. (See also: Gnarly) </P></DIR>

<P>Hardware </P>
<P>Screws and nuts that connect the deck and trucks. </P>
<P>Heelflip </P><DIR>

<P>Ollie, front foot goes to the toe side of the board, flicking the board with the ball of the foot, flips. land. </P></DIR>

<P>Kickflip </P><DIR>

<P>Kickflip Ollie, Ollie kickflip, Ollie flip. Ollie, front foot goes to the heel side of the board, flicking the board with your toes, board flips, land. </P></DIR>
