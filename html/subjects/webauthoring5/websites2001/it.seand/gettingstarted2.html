<P>One of the best ways to learn all about a particular division of Motorsport is to get involved in the day to day Organisation. So if you do not feel ready to compete, or simply would like a sociable friendly attachment to Special Stage Rallying, your invaluable help would be more than appreciated. Contact anyone involved from the motor clubs around the country and get activated. It could change your whole fife and at the same time help others enjoy a great exciting sport held in a responsible controlled environment. Safety and rescue are paramount in this fast developing branch of motorsport. If you feel you have greater dedication and enthusiasm and time we have a number of Marshalling Clubs and Rescue Units who are always on the look out for new members. </P>
