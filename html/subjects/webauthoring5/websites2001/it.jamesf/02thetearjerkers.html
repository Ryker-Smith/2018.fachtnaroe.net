</B></I></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black" COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roddy formed the Tearjerkers with his brother Mark in mid ’81. The Specials by this time had stopped playing live gigs due to the constant outbreaks of violence at shows; they eventually broke up after Ghost Town hit the number one spot in the UK charts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This meant that Roddy could concentrate on the Tearjerkers full-time and also allow Roddy to play the music he loved. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The band released one single Desire b/w Western Song on the independent label Chiswick Records. Also produced were a four-track promo single and a cassette tape.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately the band were never destined for chart success as the New Romantic sound had become popular and was dominating the top 40 at the time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The band had a very strong fanbase though and managed to keep on playing live gigs to appreciative up until 1986 when they eventually called it a day.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Judging by the comments from people who have bought the Skabilly Rebel CD, many people have very fond memories of the Tearjerkers days. </P>
