<P>Roddy soon picked up the guitar and toured the cabaret circuit with various show bands before forming ‘the Wild Boys’ in the mid-seventies, one of the first punk bands in Coventry.</P>
<P>In 1977 Roddy was approached by Jerry Dammers to travel to London to play guitar on some demos for the Specials and soon after he joined the band permanently.</P>
<P>Over the next several pages we will cover his time with the band and also look at his career after the Specials and continue on to the present day and what Roddy is up to right now. </P>
