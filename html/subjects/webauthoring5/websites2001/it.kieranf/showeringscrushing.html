</FONT><P>Showerings crushing is a seasonal thing that happens on an annual basis. It takes place from the start of September to Christmas. The trucks and tractors bringing the apples from Showerings orchards down the Waterford road and Annerville to the crushing yard beside the Franciscan church. The trucks park on the side of the Quay in lines obstructing the traffic while they wait to enter the yard. Also the trucks that collect the juice cause chaos as they enter and exit the back of the crushing yard.</P>
