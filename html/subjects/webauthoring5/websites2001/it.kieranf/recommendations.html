<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>RECOMMENDATIONS</P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Parking outside the Clonmel Arms Hotel</P>
</B></FONT><P>All buses should park down in the car park on the quay for whatever length of time that they are stopped. The same applies to the main wedding cars when they are holding a reception in the hotel.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Permanent Bus Stops</P>
</B></FONT><P>Why not do away with permanent bus stops and let the buses do what the buses in all other towns and cities nation wide have to do. Just come into the town pull up drop off their passengers and go away again. If for some reason they should have to stay around, leave them park in a carpark and return to the destination where they dropped off their passengers 5-10 minutes before the time of departure.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Car parks On The Edge Of Town</P>
</B></FONT><P>Build a multi-storey car park on one of the main entrances to the town that will cater for at least half the traffic which is entering our town, as this figure is just going to increase every year.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Showerings Crushing</P>
</B></FONT><P>That all of Showerings crushing should be done down beside their factory on the Waterford road.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Floods In Clonmel</P>
</B></FONT><P>The floods may not do as much damage to the countryside or town if the council made sure that all the shores and drains in the countryside were cleared in September/October, before all the heavy rain for the winter begins. </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Conclusions: </B></FONT>Build a multi-storey car park.</P>
<P>Make sure all drains are clear.</P>
<P>No permanent bus stops.</P>
<P>All crushing to be done at Showerings factory.</P>
