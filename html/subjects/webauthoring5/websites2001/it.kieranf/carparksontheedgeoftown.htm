<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Car Parks On The Edge Of Town That You See As You Enter The Town.</P>
</FONT><P>There are no major car parks at the end of town, where a person could park their car on the way into town. This would help the flow of traffic on the main streets of the town commencely as most of the hold up in traffic is people looking for parking space.</P>
<P>There is only one car park on the outskirts of town. The park behind the unmarried mothers housing which is merely a yard in comparison with the car parks on the way into such cities as Limerick and Waterford. For example, the first thing you see as you come off the bridge as you go into Waterford is a car park.</P>
<P>Some of the designated car parks in town have been rezoned for building and no other zone or area allocated in its place. Such an example of this would be the building of the County Museum beside the swimming pool.</P>
<P>Although in the last couple of months, John Higgins, proprietor of Mulcahy’s bar and Danno’s nite club in Clonmel. Has put forward an application for a multi-storey carpark, which will hold 148 cars. It will be constructed near Circles pool hall on Market Street Clonmel.</P>
