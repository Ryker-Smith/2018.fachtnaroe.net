</B></FONT><P>The first time the Corporation took up the section of road from the traffic lights on the Davis road to the gashouse bridge was to put down new sewerage pipes for the Clonmel treatment plant. They had this just finished when they decided that the town gas pipes were leaking, so they took back up the section of street again but afterwards left the street in an untravelable state. The last time they did the street they smoothed off the whole street and then came back a week later and took up a section near the bridge.</P>
<P>The Corporation also take up Mary street on a regular basis with no regard what so ever for the local shops or businesses that are trying to make a living, or the traffic obstruction they are causing. They do not show the same respect for a small store as they show for the bigger supermarkets such as Dunne stores and Easons.</P>
<P>As in this situation they ask the store if it would be suitable for them to do the job at such a time, if not they put it off until the store is closed or not as busy. </P>
