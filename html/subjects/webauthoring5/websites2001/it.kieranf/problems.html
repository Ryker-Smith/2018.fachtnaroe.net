<P>*Permanent bus stops taking up the parking spaces of several cars all day.</P>
<P>*No car park at either end of the town, that you would see as you enter the town and stop the build up of cars looking for spaces as they come down the main streets, so traffic would flow more smoothly.</P>
<P>*Car parks in Clonmel have been allocated and then when this place of parking has to be built on for some reason. The local authority</P>
<P>don't allocate a new location in place of the old one.</P>
<P>. *The Corporation digging up the street and other sections of road over and over again also causes traffic problems.</P>
<P>&nbsp;*Showerings is a seasonal thing that goes on in Clonmel from the start of September to Christmas.</P>
<P>*Something that may occur on an annual basis is flooding in the middle of the winter months. Which can close off a lot of routes into and out of town.</P>
