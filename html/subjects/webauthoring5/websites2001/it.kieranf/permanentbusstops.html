</B></FONT><P>There should be no need for buses to be parked in the centre of town for 2-3 hours while they are waiting to be filled. When they do this they take up the valuable parking space for at least several who may have just come into town for an hour and left. Also by having a permanent bus stop, if you park in the bus stop between certain hours even if there is no bus there you will be fined.</P>
