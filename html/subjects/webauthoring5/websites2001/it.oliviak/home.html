Lately people are constantly turning against the use of antibiotics and chemical drugs and preparations. People are increasingly turning to Ancient Healing methods and practices. People refer to these healing practices as "Alternative Medicine" even though they have been around for centuries, long before Penicillin, Paraceatamol, Morphine and Anesthesia were ever discovered. This might make you wonder which is the "Alternative"?
<P>
Most of these beautiful ancient therapies do not have side affects and even though Stress has only lately been acknowledged as an illness many complementary therapies have numerous effective methods of dealing with stress.

This website just looks at a few of the many Ancient, Spiritual, Healing therapies that one can avail of if they are tired of Anti-biotics and Painkillers which have so many harmful side effects.
