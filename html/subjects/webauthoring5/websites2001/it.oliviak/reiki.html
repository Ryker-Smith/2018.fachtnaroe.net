Reiki is a hands-on healing technique which combines the utilisation of life force that is present in all living things - ki - with the warmth, reassurance, and healing power of human touch.
<P>
Although it is most popularly known as a hands-on healing technique, Reiki can also become an integral part of life for those who have been initiated. It helps with health problems, but this is only a small part of its wondrous attributes. It can help in just about any area of your life that you would like it to.
<P>
The word Reiki, literally translated, means Universal Life Force and this is exactly what it is. It is everywhere, limitless, abundant, ecological, environmentally friendly, cruelty free, cost-effective, suitable for vegetarians, vegans, carnivores and available to anyone who has been attuned to access it. The attunements process which is instigated by an initiated Master is like tuning a radio set to pick up a particular station. Please note that there are other healing rays that can be accessed by non initiated persons. To use this particular ray you must been attuned to do so. Spiritual healers that have been initiated to Reiki say that the different energies have their own feel to them.
<P>
Reiki, although not called that in times long passed, was part of a whole that included healing techniques and self-awareness, development, growth and means of living life in harmony and happiness. To work with this system does not require you to believe or be greatly skilled. However, a desire to work with it is necessary and dedicated practice enhances the results. The self-treatment is paramount in the development of the Reiki-initiated person, and is a deceptively simple way of growing and benefiting
