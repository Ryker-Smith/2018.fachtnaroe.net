<P>
Massage, acupressure and shiatzu can all be used to achieve mental and physical and mental relaxation. Massage is particularly effective in easing tensions and knotted tissue, increasing the circulation of the blood , and stimulating the lymphatic system, one of the chief routes for ridding the body of toxins.
<P>
Take the time to prepare your massage environment properly. Make sure the room is comfortable and warm an softly lit - fragranced candles are a good way of lighting the room. Massaging oil and plenty of towels have to be used and play some relaxing music.
