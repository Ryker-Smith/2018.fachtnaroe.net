<P>
Yoga aims to achieve a state of physical, spiritual and mental well being through the practice of a series of poses. As well as through conscious relaxation and contemplation.
<P>
The poses or postures, known as 'asanas', are practised slowly, with concentration on breathing. This in time creates a sense of inner peace and harmony of the body and mind.
<P>
A number of different types of yoga are practised in the West, so you will find that classes tend to differ in emphasis and style. Always ask in advance of trying a class about the level of yoga offered and your own suitability for it.
<P>
Yoga helps to make the head and neck feel lighter, thus relaxing the mind. Through regular practice the shoulders become less tense, enabling a more efficient blood flow around the body; this, in turn, speeds up the elimination of toxins. Cleansing of lactic acid strengthens the leg muscles, which helps to create a sense of emotional stability.
