<P>
T'ai chi consists of a series of gentle, circular movements (rather like swimming in the air) that exercise the muscles, unify the body and mind, and encourage an even flow of chi (energy) around the body. Inner tensions are released and toxins flow out of the muscles, so that both mind and body benefit from this contemplative and fluid system of exercises.
<P>
T'ai chi can improve muscle tone and increase control over the movements of the body. It is also believed to strengthen the gastrointestinal tract, thus aiding the elimination of waste matter.

<P>

<LI>energy boosters
<LI>dealing with stress
<LI>taking a new view of your worries
