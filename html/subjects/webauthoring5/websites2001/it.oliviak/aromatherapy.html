The pure essences of aromatic plants have been prized for thousands of years for their health-giving properties and heady scents. The ancient art of aromatherapy has been used to harness the therapeutic powers of essential oils in a relaxing, restorative massage that combines the sense of smell with the healing value of touch. Use the beneficial properties of the oils to treat common ailments, promote good health and emotional well being, and to enhance every aspect of your life. These potent, volatile essences are natures' gift to the mind and body.
<P>
The value of natural plant oils has been recognized for more than 6000 years, for their healing, cleansing, preservative and mood enhancing properties, as well as for the sheer pleasure of their fragrances. Today these properties are being rediscovered as we look to the wisdom of past eras and civilizations to restore the balance that has been lost in modern-day life.

Today it has been made very easy to safely purchase and use Essential Oils. They can be inhaled by simply cindling an oil burner and adding a few drops of oil to water in the burner. Drops of oil can be added to a bath or put on a pillow or other material that will be close to the body. Some oils can be taken orally and rubbed directly on to the skin but they must be mixed correctly using a carrier oil. Massaging with essential oils has proven to be a very effective way of combining the two treatments.
<P>
Careful when using oils as they can be dangerous if not used properly.
