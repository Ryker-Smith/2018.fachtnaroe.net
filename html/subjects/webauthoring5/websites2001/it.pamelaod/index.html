<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For my report on asthma I looked up on the Internet for information that I find very useful it gave me a lot of information of what asthma is and also how you can get asthma.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also went up to the clinic to get leaflets on asthma that helped me to find out what you can help asthma and also how to take care of an asthma attack. I also find out what people use when they have asthma to help them throw it all.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I handed out appendices to a family that suffers from asthma. Which they were a great help as well. They gave me a lot of answers to my questions on how they handled asthma.      </P>
