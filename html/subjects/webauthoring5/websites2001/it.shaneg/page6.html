</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DeValera once more entered Dail Eirann, but on this occasion it seems he had matured as politician. It seemed impossible for deValera to continue his goal for a united republic under the political stance of Sinn Fein. On the 11th of August 1927 Eamon deValera, with the followers of his new party took the oath of allegiance. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DeValera came under enormous criticism because of this. It seemed like the civil war was a futile effort after the Fianna Fail TDs took this oath. This was surely going to be another smear on deValera’s career, one more subject that he could be criticised on.</P>
