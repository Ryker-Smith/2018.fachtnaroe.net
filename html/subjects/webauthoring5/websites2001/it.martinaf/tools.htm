<blockquote><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Tools, equipment and
materials for preparation.</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>It is important to have the right
tools for the right job.&nbsp; The main tools used in the preparation of
a room are scrapers, filling knives, sandpaper, steam strippers, and blow
torches.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Scrapers</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>There are several different type
of scrapers that may be used for different stripping jobs.&nbsp; The flat
slightly flexible scrapers such as the <b>Broad-blade</b> and the <b>Narrow-blade</b>
are used for scraping flat surfaces such as ceilings, walls and flush doors.&nbsp;
These scrapers come in different sizes such as 4", 3" or 1".&nbsp; They
can be used for removing wallpaper, paint, ceiling tiles as well as raking
out cracks. Scrapers for removing paint from mouldings such as door or
window frames are called <b>Shave Hooks</b>.&nbsp; These are either <b>Combination
Shave Hook</b> which can be used on rounded mouldings or&nbsp; <b>Triangular
Shave Hook</b> which removes paint from corners of window and door frames.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Skarsten scrapers</b> hold a
razor sharp blade and will strip paint back to the bare wood.&nbsp; They
are very good for stripping paint or varnish off hand rails on staircases.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Glass scrapers</b> hold a Stanley
blade and are used for removing paint from glass such as window panes or
from ceramic tiles.&nbsp; Always make sure the blade is not blunt as it
is very easy to scratch the surface.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Wire brush</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>A wire brush may also be used for
removing loose or flaking paintwork.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Sandpaper</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Sandpaper can either come in sheets
or on a roll.&nbsp; Usually the roll of paper is better value for money.&nbsp;
There are different grades such as fine grade, medium grade and coarse
grade.&nbsp; You can also use a sanding block which has different grades
of coarsness on each side.&nbsp; Sanding blocks can also be rinsed out
with water and used many times.&nbsp; The reason for sanding down is to
remove any flaking paint, bits of old wallpaper and adhesive, to remove
any glaze as well as leaving a smooth finish to the surface.&nbsp; It also
gives the surface a key.&nbsp; As with using a scraper on wood when sanding
down wood always sand with the grain.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Electric Sander</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>There are a variety of electric
sanders including disc sander and drum sander.&nbsp; Electric sanders are
mainly used on wood like floors and doors.&nbsp; They are not suitable
for removing heavy coats of gloss paint as the sand paper clogs up quickly.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Hot Air Gun</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Hot air guns are like an extra
hot hair dryer.&nbsp; They are very good for removing varnish.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Blow Torches.</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Blow torches soften the paint or
varnish.&nbsp; They use bottles of gas and soften the paint or varnish
by melting it from the heat of the flame.&nbsp; Always be careful when
using a blow torch as the hat paint can burn the skin and hot flakes may
go into the eyes.&nbsp; It is always best to wear gloves and safety goggles
when using a blow torch.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Steam Strippers.</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Steam strippers are used for removing
wallpaper and work by softening the adhesive underneath the paper thus
making it easy to remove the paper.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Chemical strippers.</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Chemical strippers are mainly used
on paint or varnish.&nbsp; They work by dissolving the paint.&nbsp; They
can be very irritating to the skin so care should always be taken when
using them as they can burn the skin.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Ladders.</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>When decorating any kind of room
you will almost certainly need to use a ladder.&nbsp; Ladders can be very
dangerous if not used properly.&nbsp; You should avoid using a chair or
table as a substitute for a ladder, these were not designed for standing
on and reaching a height.&nbsp; It is very easy to fall from an insecure
ladder or a chair on top of a table.&nbsp; Always choose the appropriate
ladder for the job.&nbsp; Make sure the ladder is secure on the floor.&nbsp;
Make sure the ladde is high enough for the job.&nbsp; Never use a ladder
if you have to stand on the top rung or if you have to reach further than
arms length to the side of the ladder.&nbsp; It is very easy to lose your
balance or to unbalance a ladder which results in falling off.&nbsp; Never
rest tools or equipment on a ladder, if they fall off it can cause serious
damage to people below.</font></font>
