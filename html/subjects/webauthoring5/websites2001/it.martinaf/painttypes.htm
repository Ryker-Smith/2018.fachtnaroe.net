<blockquote><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Types of Paint.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Water based paints:</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Matt Emulsion</b> paint is suitable
for walls and ceilings.&nbsp; It is a very easy paint ot work with.&nbsp;
Can be applied either by brush or roller.&nbsp; All tools used are cleaned
by using water.&nbsp; Matt emulsion comes in many differnt colours and
you can even have your own personal colour mixed.&nbsp; This emulsion dries
to a flat finish.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Vinyl Silk Emulsion </b>has the
same properties as matt emulsion, it is water based and all tools are cleand
using water but it is not as easy to use.&nbsp; Vinyl Silk dries with a
slight sheen and is more hard wearing than matt.&nbsp; The difference between
the two paints is tht Vinyl Silk has Acrylic add to it.&nbsp; It dries
to a washable finish unlike matt.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Oil based paints:</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Primer </b>is used on bare wood
that is being prepared for a pint finish.&nbsp; It seals the wood and makes
it less porous as well as giving the wood a key.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Undercoat</b> is mainly used
on woodwork.&nbsp; It is applied after any primer hads been applied.&nbsp;
Even when painting over already painter woodwork undercoat should always
be applied before the finishing coat.&nbsp; It will cover dark colours
and provide a key for the finishing paint.&nbsp; Cleean all tools with
white spirit.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Gloss Paint</b> is used as a
finish mainly for woodwork and metalwork.&nbsp; It is a hardwearing paint
and when it is dry it has a high sheen hence the name gloss.&nbsp; Gloss
paint needs to be applied sparingly as applying a heavy coat will end up
with unsightly drips and runs.&nbsp; It is better to apply 2 light coats
of gloss rather thatn one heavy coat.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Eggshell Paint</b> is suitable
for walls, ceilings, and woodwork.&nbsp; It is very good in areas where
therte will be a lot of moisture like a kitchen or bathroom.&nbsp; It is
a hardwearing paint.&nbsp; Eggshell is very good for walls and ceilings
that are badly stained. It comes in a variety of colours.</font></font></blockquote>
