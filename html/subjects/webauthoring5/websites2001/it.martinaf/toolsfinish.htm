<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Paintbrushes.</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>There are a wide variety of paintbrushes
on the market and this can make it hard to choose the right brush for the
job.&nbsp; A good brush will always cost what may seem to be expensive
but it will be worth it in the long run.&nbsp; The saying 'you get what
you pay for# is very true when it comes to decorating tools.&nbsp; A good
paintbrush should hold the paint well and should be flexible as if&nbsp;
the paint is gliding over the surface.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Emulsion brushes</b> are usually
a lot thicker and have longer bristles.&nbsp; They need to be flexible
when loaded with paint.&nbsp; When cutting in walls and ceilings you have
to have a flexible brush so you can get right into any corners and fill
with paint.&nbsp; They come in various sizes, 1/2in, 1in, 2in and 4in.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Oil brushes</b> usually come
in 1/2in, 1in,2in and 3in sizes.&nbsp; The more these brushes are uses
the better they perform.&nbsp; When you have a nes brush it is always better
to break it in by using on undercoat or primer before using it on the finish
coat.&nbsp; Soon you will notice the vbrush taking shape and will find
it easier to use the more it is used.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>All brushes come in natural bristle
or synthetic fibre.&nbsp; Usually natural bristles are best but nowadays
some very good synthetic brushes can do the job just as good.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Rollers.</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Like brushes, rollers come in many
different sizes and textures.&nbsp; They can cover an area in a fraction
of the time it&nbsp; would take to use a brush.&nbsp; A roller will also
give a nice even finish if applied evenly and the paint is spread out evenly.</font></font></blockquote>
