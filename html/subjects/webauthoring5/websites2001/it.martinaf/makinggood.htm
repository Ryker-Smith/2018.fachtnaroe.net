<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Stains.</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>You may come across many different
types of stains such as smoke, water marks and felt-tip pen.&nbsp; There
are various ways of dealing with stains.&nbsp; Special Stain Blocks which
come in the form of an aerosol can be sprayed over the stained area.&nbsp;
These are very effective over small areas but can work out to be very expensive
over a large area.&nbsp; one of the vest and most inexpensive ways to cover
a stain is to paint over it with an oil based paint like Gloss, Undercoat
and Eggshell.&nbsp; One coat of oil based pint is usually enough to blank
out the stain completely.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Filling.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Types of filler:</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Filler can either be ready mixed
or come in powered form which is mixed with water.</font></font>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Fine Fill </b>which comes as
a ready mix is suitable for use on wood work.&nbsp; It comes in a tub and
is a very smooth filler.&nbsp; Never over fill with ready mix as it is
very hard to rub down once it has driedc.</font></font>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1><b>Flexible Filler</b> also known
as <b>Caulk</b> comes in a tube witha a nozzle which is used with a special
gun.&nbsp; It is suitable for fillin joints in woodwork such as tops oskirting
s and door frames.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>There will almost certainly be areas
that need filling even on newly plastered walls and ceilings.&nbsp; Start
by filling the ceiling.&nbsp; When filling large cracks fill the area from
the side and then smooth along the length of the crack with the filler
knife.&nbsp; Never over fill it is much better to fill a hole or crack
several times.&nbsp; When the ceiling has been filled it is time to fill
the walls.&nbsp; Start at a top corner of a wall and work around the room
in sequence until you end up back at where you started.&nbsp; Fill all
holes,cracks and dents in the surface.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Rubbing Down.</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Once all the filling has been finished
it is time to rub down the ceiling, walls amd woodwork completely.&nbsp;
Work from the top of the room downwards.&nbsp; Make sure every thing is
rubbed down not just areas that have been filled.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>When using any type of scraper never
dig into the surface as this will just cause damage such as dents and scratch
marks.&nbsp; The blades should not be blunt and should just scrap over
the surface.&nbsp; When using a scraper or sandpaper on woodwork always
work with the grain of the wood.</font></font></blockquote>
