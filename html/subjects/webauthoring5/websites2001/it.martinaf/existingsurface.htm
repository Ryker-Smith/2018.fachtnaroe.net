<blockquote><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Preparation of Walls
and Ceilings when the existing surface is:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Wallpaper</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>When removing wallpaper you will
need a scraper, a 4" paint brush and a bucket of water.&nbsp; Removing
wallpaper can be very easy or can end up being a very hard and time consuming
job.&nbsp; To start off try and remove the top layer of paper.&nbsp; The
best way to do this is to lift the two bottom corners of the paper with
a scraper and try to peel away the whole layer of paper in one sheet.&nbsp;
When top layer of paper has been removed starting from the top right hand
side of the wall wash down with the brush and water.&nbsp; Completely soak
the paper with water and allow to soak in for a short time.&nbsp; Using
a scraper and starting at the bottom of the wall scrap away as much paper
as possible.&nbsp; Any stubborn areas may need to be soaked more than once.&nbsp;
It is often advised in DIY books and magazines to score the paper but this
is wrong..It serves no purpose to score the walls.&nbsp; Scoring the walls
usually ends up with damaging the&nbsp; plaster&nbsp; by leaving score
marks.&nbsp; So the best method is a paint brush, a bucket of water and
a scraper.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Emulsion paint</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>When the existing surface is emulsion
paint the problem areas to look for are flaking paint or blisters in the
paint.&nbsp; If there are areas like this use a scraper to remove all the
loose paint</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Gloss or Eggshell paint</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>As with emulsion check for unsound
paint and remove with a scraper.&nbsp; Wash down with sugar soap to remove
grease.</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Distemper</font></font></b>
<br><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Distemper is like a thin layer
of chalk which prevents paint adhering to the wall or ceiling.&nbsp; It
can be a nuisance to remove.&nbsp; The best way is to use a scraper and
sandpaper.&nbsp; Completely remove any loose paint.</font></font>
<p><font color="#663366"><font size=+1>Once all the paper or flaking paint
has been removed it is then time to rub the walls and ceiling down with
sandpaper.&nbsp; It is very important to rub down as this removes any rough
patches and leaves a smooth feel to the walls.&nbsp; Also when you rub
down you will come across any problem areas that you may have missed.&nbsp;
So starting with the ceiling and then working from the tops of the walls
down to the tops of the skirting boards rub every thing down including
the tops of the skirting boards and edges of door frames and window frames.</font></font></blockquote>
