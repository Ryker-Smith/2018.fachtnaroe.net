</B></I></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff"><P>For the web page I made two questionnaires, these questionnaires were then given to a class of ten students who are under twenty. These questionnaires were extremely useful as they allowed me to understand why some youths do not attend mass.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I would like to thank the priest who participated in my interview, he was able to tell me the churches views on why youths are not going to mass.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I would also like to thank those who answered the questionnaires, without these I could not obtain sufficient information for my report.</P>
