</B></I></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">There are many conclusions from this web page:</P>
<P>The web page has shown clear facts. These facts are that out of ten young people mass is not an important factor in their lives as eight people say it is boring and two think that it is time consuming. Nine people however believe in God. Out of ten people only three attend mass regularly which is very poor for a country where church life is extremely important. Four people attend mass now and again and three do not attend mass at all. The reasons for these figures are very interesting. The majority says mass is boring and not relevant to youths, the suggestions were to introduce more music and discuss more topics that concern youths. Eight people will encourage there children to attend mass but will not force them, it will be their own choice. Nobody gave a reason for why they will encourage their children to go to mass, it maybe because they might have been encouraged to go to mass themselves.</P>
<P>The most important points in this web page are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Three people out of ten attend mass regularly. </LI>

<LI>Eight people find mass boring. </LI>
<LI>The majority thinks more topics relating to youths should be discussed. </LI>
<LI>Ten out of ten will encourage their children to attend mass.</LI></UL>
