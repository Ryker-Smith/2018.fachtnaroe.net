</I></U><P>The purpose of this web page is to research why youths have given up on Church society. Nowadays very little of youths attend mass. This is an issue I think needs to be investigated as after all youths of today are Irelands future. If they do not attend mass now then it is likely that when they are older and have children themselves they will not practice their religion, and this will set an example for their children.</P>
<P>I made questionnaires for a class, which had ten people under the age of twenty. The results of the questionnaire were very interesting and I was able to get a better understanding of why youths have given up on Church society. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Information for the web page was obtained as follows:</P>
