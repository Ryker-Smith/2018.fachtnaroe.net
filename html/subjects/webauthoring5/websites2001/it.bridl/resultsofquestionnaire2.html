</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff">Out of the same ten, nine youths practice Catholicism.</P>
<P>&nbsp;If there were more interesting priests who could relate to today’s youth four people would not attend. The general response was if mass related to them other younger people might attend. </P>
<P>&nbsp;The majority of the ten people stated that music would make mass far more interesting. One person feels that youths don’t understand the concept of mass and finds the bible old-fashioned.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Eight people said that they would encourage their children to attend mass. Everybody said that they would not force their children, they will allow them to decide themselves. </P>
