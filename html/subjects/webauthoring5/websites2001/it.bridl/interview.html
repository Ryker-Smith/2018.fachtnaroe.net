<P>1. Are young people attending mass?</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>No, in recent years surveys have indicated that the numbers among youths attending mass have declined.</P></DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. Why do you think that young people are not going to mass?</P><DIR>

<P>I think that a lot of young people do not have faith in the church system nowadays.</P></DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>3. What do you think the church should do to encourage young people to attend mass?</P><DIR>

<P>The church should encourage youths to attend mass, in order to do this the church should involve youths on a more regular basis and deal with issues which are relevant to them.</P></DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. How do you think the church could get more involved in young people’s lives?</P><DIR>

<P>The church could try to set up support groups for teens who have problems. The church could also talk about God with youths and about the importance of having a belief.</P></DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>5. Why do you think that more teens don’t have faith than when you were a teen?</P><DIR>

<P>It is the responsibility of the parents to nurture the religious beliefs and the faith of the child, but many parents neglect the responsibility and so the children turn to society for the answers, it provides them with inadequate sources of belief i.e. television, alcohol, drugs etc.</P>
