			<H3>1. Cycling</H3>
<H3>Cycling - Vale of Honey</H3>
<H3>Co. South Tipperary</H3>

<H3>Clonmel, the Vale of Honey, lying on the banks of the River Suir, beneath the Comeragh Mountains, offers both beauty and tranquility to the leisure cyclist sauntering through its by-ways. We have three mountain ranges on our doorstep, the ideal locations for a leisurely hike or indeed some serious training in the footsteps of the world's No.1 Sean Kelly, a native of Carrick-on-Suir. This area is steeped in history offering numerous interesting places to visit - The Rock of Cashel; Cahir Castle; The Swiss Cottage; Cahir; Ormonde Castle; Carrick-on-Suir; Kilkenny Castle and Waterford City, to name but a few.

<H3>2. Golf<H/3>

<H3>Clonmel Golf Club</H3>

<H3>Established 1911 Set on the scenic slopes of the Comeragh Mountains just a short distance out of town, Clonmel golf course measures 5768 metres and is a testing course with features abounding. The clubhouse, built in 1984 with an alpine-like design, has appropriately a backdrop of fir and pine-covered mountains. "It's a hightly enjoyable layout that remains largely unrecognised… You get the feeling of getting away from it all with only the sound of streams babbling down from the mountains and the birds to interrupt the tranquility". (Golf World)</H3>

<H3>Open All Year. If you take lessons at an equestrian centre, it will cost you around £8 per hour (average). The centre will provide you with a hat.

<H3>6. Angling</H3>

<H3>Trout and Salmon Fishing - Clonmel area</H3>
<H3>Co. South Tipperary</H3>

<h3>The Suir provides excellent Trout fishing throughout the season which starts in March and ends in September. Average Weight: 1/2 lb, 3/4lb, 2, 3 and 4 lb. Trout are recorded each season, but not in any great numbers. Mostly Fly Fishing is best, any legal method is allowed on most stretches. Best months are from April on when the evening Rise starts. Trout will start to feed about an hour and a half before dusk and continue to rise until about an hour after dark. SALMON Salmon fishing has been on the decline over the past number of seasons (mainly due to drift netting at sea with mono filament nets which are illegal for Salmon fishing). However, some fairly good runs of Atlantic Salmon still manage to enter the Suir from June until the end of September when the season ends. Fishing is provided by local fishing clubs and private fishing owners.</H3>
