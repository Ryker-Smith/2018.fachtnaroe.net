		<HR>
		<H3>Clonmel Racecourse (Powerstown Park)  has been a popular venue 
		for horse racing for more than 150 years.<H3> 

		<H3>The racecourse is a right handed track of one and a quarter miles. 
		It is recognised as a demanding National Hunt course with a stiff uphill 
		climb followed by a gradual downhill run with an uphill finish. Viewing 
		of racing from all points in the enclosure is exceptional. An abundance 
		of mature trees and shrubs enhance the aesthetic quality of the 160 acre 
		racecourse environment. Some of the many famous horses that have ran at 
		Powerstown are Danoli, Dorans Pride, Unsinkable Boxer, Foxchapel King, and 
		Imperial call to mention just a few. Renowned trainers like Aiden O' Brien 
		attend many of our races.<H3>

		<H3>The catchment area of the Racecourse includes Cork, Waterford, Kilkenny 
		and Limerick. Waterford Airport is only 30 miles away, while both Cork and 
		Shannon are each a mere 60 mile journey.</H3> 

		<H3>The town of Clonmel is a very historic and interesting  town which lies 
		at the foot of the Comeragh mountains and is situated in the valley of the broad 
		and beautiful river Suir. Views of the Comeragh mountains can be clearly seen from 
		the racecourse.</H3>

		<H2>HISTORY</H2>
		<HR>
		<H3>Clonmel Racecourse is located to the North of the town of Clonmel.Racing which had 
		been open and free to spectators for over a hundred years was enclosed in 1913 by 
		Villiers Morton Jackson and became the commercially run Powerstown Park racecourse.</H3>


																																																																						
		<H3>Morton Jackson also roped in the bookies to a distinct area of the course, banned 
		gaming side-shows, brought in detectives and police to deter pickpockets and provided entry 
		to a roofless grandstand accommodating 1500 at a charge of two shillings a head.</H3>

		<H3>Since then Clonmel has grown and developed and today it is not uncommon to have in excess 
		of 120 horses running at any one meeting. In 1988 a Supporters Club was formed whose aim is to 
		promote racing at Clonmel by obtaining additional sponsorship, increasing prize money and 
		improving amenities and further encourage local interest and involvement. Extensive refurbishment 
		has been carried out at Clonmel Racecourse during 1998. A new grandstand including a bar and catering 
		complex has been constructed. Along with a new computerised turnstile entrance, the weighroom/jockeys 
		room has also been extensively upgraded and refurbished.</H3>

		has been rented out by the Pony Club, Caravan Club, Canine Club and the Clonmel 
		Agricultural Show to name but a few.<H3>

		<H3>The location is convenient, with accessible ample parking. The setting is picturesque 
		and the staff are professional, experienced and helpful. The course being a neat, oval course 
		slopes up from the stands, making for good viewing. The upstairs bar of the spacious Club

		more remote stand, will also give a very good view of the track.</H3>

		<H3>CORPORATE HOSPITALITY facilities are available in the Main Stand where an area may be reserved. 
		Catering as required, can also be arranged in the Supporters Club Bar which is a spacious bar. This

		area for those at the summer  meetings. There is also a smaller room attached to this bar which is 
		available to small parties. All these areas are fully carpeted and well appointed. The Corporate Suite 
		can cater for 100-150 seated and 200 standing. CCTV and tote betting facilities are featured in this 
		area.</H3>
