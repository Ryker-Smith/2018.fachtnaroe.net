			<H3>Clonmel Town FC</H3>
			<H3>Soccer has been a major sport in Clonmel since the turn of the last Century 
			with various clubs representing Clonmel down through the years. The idea of forming 
			the present club was discussed in Fenn Cummin's house. Following that meeting the club 
			was formed on April 23rd 1963, with 'Bohemians Clonmel' being adopted as the name of 
			the club.</H3>

			<H3>In their first season Bohs won the Tipperary league.From 1966 onwards the club competed 
			in the Waterford league and in 1968 won the Munster Junior up. 1973 saw the club take the 
			giant step into Senior Football. In 1976 the club decided to change their name to Clonmel Town F.C 
			in order to promote an affinity to the Town.</H3>

			<H3>During the 1981/82 season Clonmel Town were runners up to Cobh Ramblers in the Munster Senior 
			League and also lost out to Ramblers in the final of the Munster Senior Cup. In 1986 the club won 
			the Munster Junior Cup for the second time, when they defeated Ballincollig 1-0 in the final. 1994 
			was the proudest year in the clubs History. The greatest prize in junior football the FAI Junior cup, 
			was won when they defeated New Ross 5-1 in the final.</H3>

			<H3>Captain that day was Cyril Conran, who also had the distinction of being the FAI Junior player 
			of the year. Indeed many people would argue that this side was the finest football team ever to come 
			out of Clonmel. In that season the team lost only one game out of a total of 53 matches. The club 
			has since been semi-finalist twice in the competition and became one of the first four junior clubs 
			to compete in the FAI Senior cup, in the season 99-2000.</H3>

			<H3>Many Town players have gone on to apply their trade in the League of Ireland. Sean Kiely not 
			only played for Waterford in the League but also in 1980 played in the European Cup Winners Cup. 
			Their are currently five ex-Town players playing in the National League. Ollie Cahill and Stephen 
			Napier(Cork City), Aaron Moroney, Paul Scully and Kevin Waters (Waterford Utd).</H3>

			<H3>During the heady days, the club was managed in turn by Peter Bryan(former Oxford Utd, Waterord 
			and Inter League player.) Shay Brennan (Man.Utd and Irish International R.I.P) Al Casey (RIP) 
			(Waterford) Dave Kirby(Waterford).In addition , Clonmel Locals Buddy Anderson Danny Gibbons, 
			Richie Blanche ,Sean Kiely, Martin Quinlivan and Billy Byrne.</H3>

			<H3>Since the clubs return to Junior Football in 1983 the honours list is impressive in the TSDL 
			Premier Division and cup Competitions.</H3>
