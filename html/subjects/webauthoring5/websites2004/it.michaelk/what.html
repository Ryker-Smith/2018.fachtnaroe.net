			<H3>The American Medical Association refers to Alcoholism as a disease that can be arrested but not cured.</H3>

			<H3>One of the symptoms is an uncontrollable desire to drink.  If the disease is not halted alcoholism can lead to insanity or death.</H3>

			<H3>The only way to halt alcoholism is total abstinence.  Alcoholic's Anonymous is regarded as the best method of arresting alcoholism.  The reasons that I chose this subject for my report was because of the growing problem of alcoholism in the country and that I wanted to be aware of the help available to combat this disease in my locality.</H3>
