			<H2>To. Sum. Up.</H2>
			<H3>Because the alcoholic is ill, the alcoholic hurts him/herself and others.  Due to the family's close association to him/her, they also develop problems.  The best way to help the addict is to build their own mental strength, correct their attitudes, be kind to the alcoholic and learn to detach from the problem.</H3>

			<H2>Alcohol. An. Alateen's. Story.</H2>

			<H4>My childhood in an alcoholic home was quite difficult for me personally.  I was an angry and bitter child and would always be fighting with my friends and family and would often be going from pub to pub in an effort to find my alcoholic parent.</H4>
			<H4>When I was twelve years old I was brought to Alateen where I found that as I worked the Twelve Step Program my attitude and outlook changed for the better.</H4>
			<H4>As my outlook on life and the family disease of alcoholism changed so did my relationships with my friends and family.  I learned to express my feelings without using voilence and became a more thoughtful and happier person.  I started to do better in school and learned that the only person responsible for my feelings and happiness was myself, this gave me the strenght to take responsibility for my own actions and reactions.
			Thanks to the Alateen program I now have the courage to detach from the illness in my family and to be myself in no matter what situation I encounter.</H4>
