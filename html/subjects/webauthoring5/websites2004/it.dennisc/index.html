<h1><font color="#ff6600"><b>Pubs in Clonmel worth a visit.</b></font> </h1>
 </div>
  
<p>Clonmel is set on the N24, the main road from Limerick - Waterford, practically
on the border with Co.Waterford.  Be warned if you're driving as the town
has a tricky one-way traffic system.</p>
  
<p>The upside of this is the number of pedestrianized streets which make
it a good town to wander around on foot.</p>
  
<p>It's easy to forget that Clonmel is one of the largest towns in Ireland
(nearly 30,000 people) and as such has many urban trappings, a student population
(due to the recently-opened Institute of Technology,  a selection of hotels,
plenty of bright, spacious pub (the kind you'll have found in abundance in
the main cities already) and nightclubs to boot.</p>
  
<p>You might be slightly surprised to find both a McDonald's and an Abrakebabra
fast food outlet (indicating the presence of students and young families),
given the fact that the mountains of  Slievenamon to the north-east and the
Galtees to the west are still visible, but then Clonmel is generally more
cosmopolitan than the rest of Tipperary would give you to expect.</p>
