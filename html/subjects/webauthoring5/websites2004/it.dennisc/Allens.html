  <H1>Allens Bar & Restaurant</H1>


<h4>John Allen's Bar is situated in Lower Irishtown between the beautiful Parish Church of St. Mary's and the Historic West Gate.</h4>
 <h4>It's setting is particularly lovely with a garden to the rear of the premises leading down to the River Suir, and sits in the shade of the Comeragh Mountains.</h4>
 <h4>It is family owned and managed. Serving good wholesome food daily it's a must whilst traveling through the sunny South East.
 A favorite with all our guests is Tipperary organic ice-cream, so go ahead and treat yourself.</h4>
