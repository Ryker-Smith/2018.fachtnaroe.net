			<H3>Clonmel is the biggest inland town in Ireland and is
			situated in a valley among the Comeragh and Knockmealdown
			mountains with the Slievenamon Mountain to the East of
			the town. The River Suir runs through the town down
			to meet the Celtic Sea on the South Irish coastline.</H3>

			<H3>Clonmel is built on the N24 between Limerick and
			Waterford. When visiting the town it is best to walk
			as it has a tricky one way system.</H3>

			<H3>Clonmel is full of history.
			It was walled and fortified in the 14th Century and was
			home to the powerful Butler Anglo-Norman family. In 1516
			it was besieged and taken by the Earl of Kildare and in
			1650 it was attacked by Oliver Cromwell, who found great
			resistance.</H3>

			<H3>Charles Bianconi became Major of Clonmel twice and gave
			Ireland its first transport system. Charles was brought to
			Ireland as a young child from Italy. In 1843 Charles had one
			hundred vehicles (horse and carage) in use.</H3>
