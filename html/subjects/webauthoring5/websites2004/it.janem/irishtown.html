			<H3>Irishtown was built outside the town walls by the Native-Irish in Medieval times.
			The Irish-Natives were compelled to live outside the town walls. They were only
			allowed into the town during the day to trade or work and had to leave the town
			by night fall so that the gates could be closed behind them.</H3>
