<H3>Clonmel's Main Guard (pictured below) is one of the town's major landmarks. Built in 1674 as  a palatine Courthouse for the Duke of Ormonde, it later served as a hostel and a barracks before being converted into shops in the 1800's. The building was saved from dereliction following an eight year restoration programme and was re-opened to the public in 2003.</H3>
