<H1>A Brief History of Clonmel</H1>

		
<H3>Clonmel derives its name from Cluain Meala meaning the meadow of honey. Today it is a thriving town on the river Suir. Surrounded by the Commeragh and Knockmealdown mountains it is an excellent centre for climbing and exploring.Clonmel is steeped in history:In the 14th C it was walled and fortified and was the home of the powerful Butler Anglo-Norman family. In 1516 it was besieged and taken by the Earl of Kildare and in 1650 it was attacked by Oliver Cromwell, who found great resistance. Charles Bianconi became Mayor of Clonmel and gave Ireland it's first transport system.</H3>

 <H3>In 1843 he had a hundred vehicles in use. A portion of the old town wall which encloses St.Mary's church is well preserved. The church itself was built on the site of a 14th C church. It has a striking octaganal tower. The West Gate was rebuilt in 1831, and number 19 Main street was once a Bishop's palace. In it's rafters in 1880 were discovered letters signed by Oliver Cromwell. The Main Guard was said to have been built to a design by Cristopher Wren. On the front wall are the arms of Clonmel and those of the Palatinate of Ormond founded in the 14th C. The Franciscan church is a 19th Century restoration on the site of a 13th Century  foundation. Inside are the remains of the Butler's of Cahir.</H3>
