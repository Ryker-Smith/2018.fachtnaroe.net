<h1>Word Processing</h1>
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>Word Processing is taught based on a series of about 20 tasks, each of which must be completed in turn. At the end of the first half term, a collection of documents are specified (that represent the skills shown in the tasks) for assessment.</p>
<p>Word Processing must be completed prior to other subjects as projects require good WP skills. The ability to word-process is considered a fundamental IT skill. The majority of students will need to learn about correct punctuation and document production conventions.</p>
<p>An office productivity suite is used - of which the WP application is a part - and in learning the WP interface you learn about the common interface for the productivity suite. Either Microsoft&trade; Office, LibreOffice or OpenOffice is used. Presently we use OpenOffice on Microsoft Windows&trade;.</p>
