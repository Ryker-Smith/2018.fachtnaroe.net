<h1>Database Methods Project Guidelines</h1>
Projects are subject to change. <b>Refer back to the briefs constantly; check your email regularly.</b>
<h2>Steps - Design - 20%</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In this stage you design; other than that, you <b>do</b> nothing!</li>
  <li>If no topic is allocated, choose a suitable topic.
  </ol>
	<ul class="olul">
  	<li>Seems obvious, but decide and stick to your target.</li>
  	<li>Don't be thinking about other possibilities when you've already started one project.</li>
  	<li>Think about what you want your database to <b>do</b>.
  	</ul>
  	<ol start="2">
      <li>Now set down the aims of your project.
      </ol>
  	<ul class="olul">
    	<li>Clearly state as many aims as you have.</li>
    	<li>Don't worry about stating obvious aims - what's obvious to you may not be to the examiner.</li>
    	<li>Realise that the aims you set now are what you'll seek to achieve in your project.</li>
    	<li>At some later stage you'll look back and say "This was my aim, and this was my outcome".</li>
  	</ul>
  	<ol start="3">
      <li>Design your database table <i>on paper</i> first.
      </ol>
    	<ul class="olul">
      	<li>Think of each item of data you'll want to store.</li>
	      <li>For each, decide a name for the data item.</li>
      	<li>Next choose the details of the data type and size.</li>
      	<li> ... still all <i>on paper</i>.</li>
    	</ul>
    <ol start="4">
      <li>Next decide how you'll gather that data.</li>
      <li>What are you going to do with the data once gathered and stored?</li>
    </ol>
<h2>Steps - Implementation - 20%</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Now, you start to <b>do</b> things previously specified.</li>
  <li>Carry out and complete the project as you have designed it.</li>
  <li>A key item to monitor is that each of your project aims are achieved.</li>
  <li>Optimally this will allow you to write a brief note at the end of the project re-listing your aims and matching them up with what you have achieved.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Steps - Review/Modifications - 10%</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In this section you review your completed project. You should come up with two or more sensible and relevant improvements that, with hindsight, you feel would improve the project</li>
  <li>You do <b>not</b> carry out the suggested improvements. Just list them, with your reasons as to why you think they're a good idea.</li>
</ol>
