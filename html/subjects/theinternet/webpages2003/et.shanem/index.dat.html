<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
</B></FONT><P>The Internet began back in the late 1950’s during the Cold War. The US Department of Defence wanted a way of maintaining communications in the event of a nuclear attack. They needed a system that would still be able to operate if one computer or a whole system of computers were damaged in attacks. In 1969 the Advanced Research Projects Agency (APRA) was created. In the beginning the APRANET consisted of 4 computers, today the Internet consists of millions of computers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At the beginning of the 1980’scomputing in universities was changing from a small number of large time-sharing machines to a larger number of smaller desktop workstations. These workstations were able to run at the same speed all the time no matter how many of them were being used at the same time, unlike the bigger time-sharing machines.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By 1990 so much business had moved from the APRANET to the NSFNET (National Science Foundation, which used extremely fast and expensive supercomputers) that the APRANET was shut down.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The term Internet was first used in1982 when DAPRA launched the Internet Protocol (IP).</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Can I break the Internet?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P>The simple answer is no. The Internet was designed by the US DOD to keep communications ongoing in the event of a nuclear attack. If one of the network links became disrupted by enemy attack the traffic on it could be re-routed automatically to other links. The US had considerable difficulty in knocking out the Iraqi command network during the Gulf War. It turned out that the Iraqi’s were using network routers with standard Internet routing and recovery technology. So this goes to prove that the Internet cannot be broken!</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Who owns the Internet?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P>The answer is no one. In the early 1970’s the Internet was made available to the public, with mainly educational institutes using them. The Internet is mainly funded by governments and commercial industry. It is a free service- all you have to pay for is the cost of your telephone call.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Where did the World Wide Web come from?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>

<P>The WWW concept was designed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and scientists at CERN (Geneva), the European centre for High Energy Physics, who were interested in making easier to retrieve research documentation. A year later he had developed a 'browser/editor' program and had coined the name World Wide Web as a name for the program. The program is released free on an ftp site. This doesn't sound very dramatic but anyone used to the hassle of getting documents previously will testify that it represented a major leap forward. Once the entire dial- and retrieve-language had been simplified, the next step was to design an improved 'browser', a system which allowed the links to be hidden behind text (using a Hypertext Markup Language, HTML) and activated by a click with the 'mouse'.</P></BODY>
