<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Where did the Internet come from</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">In 1968 ARPA awarded the ARPANET contract to BBN. BBN selected a Honeywell minicomputer as the base for the building of the switch. The physical network was constructed in 1969, linking four node together: University of California in Los Angeles, SRI in Stanford, University of California in Santa Barbara and University of Utah. The network was wired via 50 KBPS circuits. At the time ARPANET were using the NCP (Network Control Protocol) to transfer data, this allowed communication between hosts running on the same circuit. Later this became known as TCP/IP, a group headed by Vinton Cerf from Stanford and Bob Kahn from Darpa developed it. This new protocol allowed diverse computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other.On January first 1983 every machine connected to ARPANET had to use TCP/IP. TCP/IP became the core Internet protocol and replaced NCT entirely.</P>
<P>In 1984 the ARPANET was divided into two networks: MILNET and ARPANET, MILNET was to serve the needs of the military and ARPANET to support the advanced research component.</P>
<P>In 1986 the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF) was created to serve as a forum for technical co-ordination by contractors for DARPA working on the ARPANET, US Defence Data Network (DDN), and the Internet core gateway system.</P>
<P>Currently the Internet society, the group who control the Internet, is trying to figure out new TCP/IP to be able to have billions of addresses rather than a limited system.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Who Runs the Internet</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">Nobody runs the Internet. While there is no central authority, there are numerous committees, businesses and government agencies that exert very real control over how the Internet is run.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Who makes the Internet work</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">Much of the work tat goes into defining and running the Internet is done by a group of organisations loosely co-ordinated by the internet society: Internet engineering task force(IETF), Internet engineering steering group(IESG), Internet architecture board(IAB), Internet assigned Number Authority(IANA) and the Internet research task force(IRSG) </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Can I Break the Internet</P>
</FONT><P>No the Internet cannot be broken. The Internet was designed by the US DOD to keep communications ongoing in the event of anything happening. If one of the network links became disrupted by enemy attack the traffic on it could be re-routed to other links. The US had difficulty in knocking out the Iraqi command with standard Internet routing and recovery technology. So this proves that the Internet cannot be broken.</P>
