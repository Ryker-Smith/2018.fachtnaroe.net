</FONT><P>When you connect your computer to another computer, you access the information stored on the other computer, as well as the information stored on your own. The amount of information you can then access is doubled. Connect to more than one computer and you have even more information at your disposal. Connecting computers together so that information can be exchanged is called Networking. It is on this idea of Networking that the Internet is based.</P>

<P>The Internet began as ARPANET, a way for the US Department of Defence to share critical data with its staff and contractors across the United States. As a national defence tool, ARPANET needed the ability to survive attacks, even nuclear attacks, so it was geographically distributed, without a central structure, and loaded with built-in redundancies and alternative routes. Later, ARPANET merged with a similar network built by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which was devoted to connecting research and educational institutions. Together, they formed the basis for what is now referred to as the Internet. For many years, traffic on these networks was restricted to Defence Department contractors, researchers and members of higher educational institutions. Due to government funding restrictions and use policies, commercial users surged onto the Internet. Every company, institution, organisation and user supports its own piece of the Internet when they add a new network or computer.</P>

<P>No single person, group, company or government owns or controls the Internet. The owners of an individual server computer are responsible for maintaining it and its connection to the Internet. Miles of telephone lines and fibre optic cables that require routers to co-ordinate the flow of information permanently connect the server computers on the Internet. The cost of maintaining these links must be met. Some users, particularly those on government or university networks, do not have access to the Internet because their employers pay the costs. The vast majority of users, however, pay a subscription fee and/or a telephone charge for access to the Internet.</P>

<P>The World Wide Web is abbreviated to WWW, and is made up of linked Web pages. Web pages are like ordinary pages; they can contain pictures, video clips, sound and text. A web site is a collection of web pages relating to a particular topic. A Nuclear Research Scientist, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in the late 1990s. The World Wide Web was originally conceived and developed for the large high-energy physics collaborations, which needed to be shared immediately between physicists world-wide. Tim and Robert Caillau wrote the first WWW client and the first WWW server along with most of the communications software, defining URLs, HTML and HTTP. Now it has millions of academic and commercial users.</P>

<P>The Internet’s logical network is composed of millions of smaller Local Area Networks that are joined together and share a common method for communicating with each other, called protocol. The Internet uses protocol called TCP/IP for sending packets of information back and forth between computers. This is what makes the Internet work. Through this common protocol, you have the ability to share information globally without worrying about where the information is physically located. Tools for using the Internet can find information no matter where it is, thanks to this agreed-upon standard. </P>
