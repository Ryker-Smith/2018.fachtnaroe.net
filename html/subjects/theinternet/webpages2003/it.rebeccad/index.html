<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The birthplace of the Internet was the United States, during the 1960s. The United States Department of Defence were worried about a nuclear attack from the Russians. In the 1960s there were very few computers and those that did exist usually filled whole rooms, and so an attack could wipe out the whole US Military computer system. The US government decided to build a ‘decentralised’ computer system. This was where a network of 4 computers were placed in different locations throughout the US. It was designed to allow scientists to share data and to access remote computer systems. This was known as Arpanet (Advanced Research Projects agency – ARPA). It was to be used to maintain command and control over US nuclear arms in the event of an attack if one of the 4 locations were attacked.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This information was sent via a packet switched network. The system was where the data was sent from computer to computer and labelled to indicate its origin and destination. In the late 1960s, four Universities were linked together. E–mail quickly became the most popular application, where it was used to discuss and collaborate research projects and other topics of interest.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the mid 70’s, Arpanet began to grow and grow, and gradually it began to move away from its roots in the military. A commercial version of Arpanet went on-line, thus giving the public an insight into computer networking, and its use in daily life. In 1980 the word &quot;Internet&quot; was used for the very first time. The bigger the Internet got, the faster it grew and during the 1980s corporations and companies began using the Internet to communicate with each other. A common language for the Internet developed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Twenty years later in 1989, there were more than 160,000 computers connected. The Internet as we know it today is the open interconnection of computer networks that allows computers and programmes to communicate directly. Today there are more than 95 million computers connected.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one person actually owns the Internet and no organisation or single person actually controls the Internet in its entirety. The Internet relies on a physical infrastructure that can connect networks to networks. The main lines that carry the bulk of the Internet traffic are owned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) such as America Online (AOL), AT&amp;T, Earthlink and Sprint. These service providers along with organisations, governments, private citizens and schools all own pieces of the infrastructure, so there is no one persons that owns it. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the expansion of The Internet problems arose. With more computer ‘hosts’ linked to the net than had been originally been envisaged, and also the volume of traffic per host was much larger this began to cause problems. The year 1984 was the introduction of Domain Name Servers (DNS). This new system introduced some tiering into US Internet addresses and a series of country codes. This made the names of host computers easier to remember. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1985, the US National Science Foundation established NSFNet, to serve US universities. This American program involved a number of decisions that were crucial for further development of the Internet. In late 1990 CERN computer scientist invented the World Wide Web. The Web as we know it today was developed for the large high-energy physics collaborations that have a high demand for sharing information instantaneous with different scientists working around the globe. Mr Tim Berners-Lee and Mr Robert Cailliau wrote the first WWW client and first WWW server. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact is that no one person makes the Internet work. The Internet runs by many different organisations in over seventy countries by numerous computer networks.</P>
