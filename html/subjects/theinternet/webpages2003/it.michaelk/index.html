<B><U><P>Background to the Internet.</P>
</B></U><P>The Internet is an enormous global network encompassing millions of computers and users.  It was not always this large.  In 1962 Paul Brennan of the RAND Corporation was commissioned by the U.S. Air Force to find a way of granting them a means of keeping control over their forces after a nuclear strike.  His response was crucial to the realisation of a computer network.  Then in 1968 the ARPANET was formed, which linked four nodes and was wired through 50Kbps circuits.  Ray Tomlinskon created the first e-mail program for the U.S. Defence Agency in 1972.  In 1973 the concept for the Internet took off with the development of TCP/IP which would allow diverse computer networks to communicate with each other.</P>

<B><U><P>Why I believe the Internet is a Democracy.</P>
</B></U><P>The Internet is unlike most hierarchical organisations we deal with in life, because there is no one &quot;in charge&quot; as the single top authority.  But there is order as a number of dedicated volunteer groups keep the Internet working through their efforts at standards development and consensus building in spite of the popular belief that no one maintains law and order on the Internet.  The original Internet, as it was extended to society generally, mixed controlled and free resources at each layer of the network.  This leads to a more egalitarian system of information control.  This brought about a very decentralised method of Internet innovation e.g. an Indian immigrant to the United States co-invented Hotmail.  Because anybody can use the resources available on the Internet and the amount of information available to Internet users coinciding with the fact that common protocols are initiated by many countries, governments leads me to believe that the Internet is a very effective democracy.</P>

<B><U><P>Who then owns the Internet?</P>
</B></U><P>No one actually owns the Internet for although it was conceived in America it has been expanded on by so many other countries through its capacity for innovation that the current ownership could only be called global.  The Internet relies on a physical infrastructure that connects networks to other networks.  There are many organisations that use the Internet and can link to each other through it e.g. governments, schools etc. but no single organisation can be said to own it all.  There are, however, organisations that oversee and standardise what happens on the Internet IP addresses and domain names e.g. the National Science Foundation.</P>

<P>Where did the World Wide Web come from?</P>
</B></U><P>The World Wide Web started in March 1989 at CERN (Conseil Europeen Pour la Recherche Nucleaire).  CERN is a meeting place for physicists from all over the world, who collaberate on complex physics, engineering and information handling projects.  The need for the WWWsystem arose from the geographical dispersion of large collaberations.</P>

<B><U><P>Can I Break the Internet?</P>
</B></U><P>The Internet cannot be physically broken because it does not rely on any one machine to keep it running.  Instead the Internet is comprised of millions of computers linked through millions of nodes that allow machines to carry on working even if other linked machines and nodes break.</P></BODY>
