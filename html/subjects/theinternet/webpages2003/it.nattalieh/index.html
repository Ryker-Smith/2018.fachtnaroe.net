<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet was conceived during the Cold War in 1969, when the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, a Department of Defence Organisation) funded research for an experiment to explore the possibility of a communications network. The objective for the U.S. military was to create a national communications system that would maintain communication integrity in the event of a national emergency and would continue to function if a disaster such as a nuclear war occurred. In the ARPANET system information moved randomly through many networks and systems rather than travelling over one line. The information was broken down into smaller pieces called packets, with each packet travelling independently through the network. Information would never travel the same route twice hence ensuring security. The new system would be impervious to attacks by other countries, (primarily the former Soviet Union).</P>

</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the first decade that the Internet was in existence, it was primarily used to facilitate communications between computers, e-mail which made it's first public appearance in 1972 at the Internet Computer Communications Conference. In 1975 the Defence Communications Agency gained administrative control of ARPANET. The mission of the agency was to facilitate the communication needs of the Department of Defence. Traffic on the network continued to increase rapidly. However, most users were not military personnel but scientists and researchers who used the network for e-mail, to support online discussion groups, allow access to distant databases and support the transfer of files between government agencies, companies and universities. Because of this dual application, ARPANET split into two networks: ARPANET - to serve the needs of the academic community and MILNET, which focused on the needs of the military. Information could be shared between these two networks so this interconnection became known as the DARPA Internet (Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) eventually shortened to the Internet.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 1980’s - </P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early 1980's several significant events occurred including the development of the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite of networking protocols, which allows computers on the Internet to communicate using a common language. It packages and addresses the information and then ensures that the information arrives safely at the intended destination. By 1983 all research networks were converted to TCP/IP protocol setting a standard for other networks therefore enabling all of the networks of the Internet to send data back and forth and it becomes the only set of protocols on the ARPANET.</P>

</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1990, HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) was introduced, this was a hypertext Internet protocol which could communicate the graphic information on the Internet thus creating a Web site which then became part of a hypertext network called the World Wide Web (WWW). The Internet was informally renamed the Web and quickly gained great popularity among Internet users.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today - </P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today most people use the term "Internet" to refer to the physical structure of the Net including client and server computers and telephone lines whereas the use the term "Web" to refer to the collection of sites and the information that can be accessed when using the Internet. </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where Did the World Wide Web come from?</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The World-Wide Web (also called The Web, WWW or W3) was first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee of CERN (the European research laboratory for particle physics in Switzerland) in March 1989; it is officially described as a "wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative, aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents." In short, the Web does to text, audio and video (both still and animated) what Gopher does to text alone. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the Web, both the end result and the means of navigation are of the form "information" (in particular, "hypermedia" information); if a word, phrase or other visual element is so indicated, (perhaps by a coloured border or some other indicator,) you may "point and click" on that element in order to navigate further through the realm of information provided. For example, a picture of a person’s face may be a link leading to information about that person.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does the World Wide Web work?</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The World Wide Web works according to the <EM>client-server model</EM>. To access the WWW the user runs a client program, a browser. The browser interacts with the user and requests documents from a server as the user asks for them. The server again sends the requested document, if the document is found. Most servers also include abilities to run external programs, which can perform small search and other tasks. The server usually sends an answer to the user when the task is completed or at the occurrence of an error. </P>

</FONT>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Nobody runs the Internet&quot;, we’re told, while it’s true that there is no central Internet authority, there are numerous committees, businesses, and government agencies that exert very real control over how the Internet is run. The important groups are:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Technical Organisations - </LI></P></UL>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the work that goes into defining and running the technical end of the Internet is done by a group of organisations loosely co-ordinated by the Internet Society, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), Internet Architecture Board (IAB), Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Steering Group.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>
<B><LI>Business – </LI></UL>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the role of the U.S. Government in management of the Internet has declined throughout the 1990s, a wide range of private companies have stepped in to perform tasks that had previously been by government agencies. Day-to-day operation of the resulting private Internet is now the business of countless companies in a variety of industries. These include telecommunications, Internet Service Providers (ISP’s), cable TV companies, hardware, software and Domain Name System (DNS) registrars.</P>

<UL>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Government – </LI></P></UL>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even as the Internet is becoming privatised, a number of key U.S. agencies still have a hand in decision-making regarding the Internet. These include the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Science Foundation (NSF), Federal Networking Council and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The U.S. government continues to provide funding for Internet research through such initiatives as the Next Generation Internet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Content regulations like the U.S. Communications Decency Act have been attempted elsewhere, and various governments and intergovernmental organisations have recently discussed issues including taxation copyrights, and encryption.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Higher Education – </LI></P></UL>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stake that Universities hold in the Internet is enormous. Collaborative research, digital libraries and distance education are a few examples. ‘Internet 2’ is a consortium of educational institutions working to build the next generation Internet.</P>
