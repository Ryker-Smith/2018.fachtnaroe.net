<P>Where did the Internet come from?</U>  </P>
</FONT><P>The ancestor of the Internet was the ARPANET a project funded by the US Department of Defence in 1969.  ARPA stands for Advanced Research Project Administration.  The branch of (DOD) is in charge of handing out grant money.  The ARPANET started out small connecting three computers in California with one in Utah, it quickly grew to span the continent.  The agency is now know as DARPA the added D is for Defence because in cease people were in doubt about where the money was coming from.  The money was coming from DOD.  The ARPANET got so successful and was difficult to manage so it was broken into two parts.</P>
<P>&#9;1.Milnet –which had a military sites.</P>
<P>&#9;2.The new smaller ARPANET which had the nonmilitary sites.</P>

<P>The two networks remained together by a technical scheme called IP (Internet Protocol) which enables traffic to be routed from one network to another as necessary.  </P>
<P>IP started with just two networks it was designed to allow for tens of thousands of networks. An unusual fact about the IP design is that every computer on an IP network is in principle just as capable as any other any machine can communicate with any other machine.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>Who owns the Internet: </FONT>No one owns the Internet and no organisation controls the Internet entirely.  More of an actual tangible entity.  The Internet relies on a physical infrastructure that connects networks to other networks.  There are many organisations, corporations, governments, schools, private citizens’ etc that all own a piece of the infrastructure but no one person owns the entire Internet.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>Can I break the Internet: </FONT>You can’t break the Internet.  If some thing so wrong try again.  Hackers send virus to the Internet to try and make it crash.  The Internet doesn’t on one machine to keep it working.  If some machines break down it doesn’t mean that the Internet is broken.  It can still run on other machines.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>Where did the World Wide Web come from: </FONT>A man named Tim<FONT SIZE=4> </FONT>Berners –Lee in late 1990’s invented the World Wide Web.  The Web was conceived and developed for the large high-energy physics collaborations which have a demand for instantaneous information sharing between physicists working different universities and institutes all over the World.  It has millions of anaemic and commercial users. The Web is an Internet based computer network that allows users on one computer to access information stored on another through the World Wide network.</P>
<P>The first World Wide Web page was wrote together by Tim Berners – Lee and Robert Colliau.</P>
