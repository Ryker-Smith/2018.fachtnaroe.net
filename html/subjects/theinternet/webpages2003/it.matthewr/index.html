</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">Who owns the Internet?</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">In a short answer nobody "owns" the Internet it is a great industry used by people all of the world to have data from anywhere in the world placed in front of them by the push of a button. The internet is used world-wide for shopping, playing games, for work purposes, schools and colleges and many more purposes.</P>
<P>The Internet is a large computer network linking smaller networks to one another. It was started in the late 1960s and developed in the 1970s to allow government and university researchers to share information.</P>
<P>It wasn’t until the late 1980s that the Internet began to be used widely. Any single group or organisation does not control the Internet. Today, the Internet offers an amazing variety of information and activities. Most people say that email is their top reason for using the internet.</P>
<P>Even though no-one specifically owns the Internet there is a large strangle-hold on it by a number of informants. The stake that Universities hold on the Internet is enormous. Collaborative research, digital libraries, and distance education are a few examples. Internet2 is a consortium of educational institutions working to build the next generation Internet.</P>
<P>Much of the work that goes into defining and running the technical end of the Internet is done by a group of organisations loosely co-ordinated by the internet society: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA), the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Steering Group (IRSG).</P>
<P>As the role of the U.S. Government in management of has declined throughout the 1990s, a wide range of private companies have stepped in to perform tasks that have been previously controlled by government agencies. Day-to-day operation of the resulting private Internet is now the business of countless companies in a variety of industries. These include telecommunications, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) cable TV companies, hardware, software, and Domain Name System (DNS) registrars and registries.</P>
