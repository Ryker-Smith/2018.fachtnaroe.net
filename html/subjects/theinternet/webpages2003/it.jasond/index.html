<B><U><P>Who Owns The Internet?</P>
</B>
</U><P>The issue of Internet ownership is more complicated than you might expect when just scratching the surface.  Most people would say that any person who uses the service, owns the Internet, be it for e-mail, ‘Surfing the Web’, or supplying your own Webpage.  </P>
<U>
</U><P>&#9;However, when you research in to the topic of Internet ownership, you discover that there is more than meets the eye.  A small handful of companies own and control the infrastructure on which the global network runs.  These companies can, and sometimes do, exert their control over the Internet to their advantage.</P>
<U>
</U><P>&#9;A small number of large corporations own and operate the fiber-optic cables which are used to connect, communicate and transfer data to its destination.  The majority of these companies are based in the U.S., which has always been the major nation in terms of Internet use. WorldCom’s UUNet division, ATT, GTE’s Internetworking, Global Crossing, Qwest Communications International and PSINet are all U.S. based companies.  Other major players outside the U.S. include Telstra, the Australian national telecommunications carrier, and Global TeleSystems Group, which offers a broadband Internet connection in 20 European countries.</P>
<U>
</U><P>&#9;Phone companies were also quick to jump on the Internet ‘bandwagon’.  Telephone companies already had their infrastructure in place, and connecting to the Internet through the phone-line was the first means of Internet access.  This extended the power of phone companies into the Internet.</P>

<P>&#9;There is no way of knowing exactly which company owns what percentage of the Internet, one figure published was that UUNet owns 30 percent of the infrastructure backbone, with every other company being placed behind UUNet. AT&amp;T claims the number two spot.</P>

<P>&#9;More importantly than trying to figure out who owns how much of the Internet, is what it might mean to have a stake in the ownership of the Internet backbone.  These companies have invested vast amounts of money into setting up and maintaining the infrastructure.  No one really knows how much power these companies possess.</P>
<U>
</U><P>So, in conclusion, no company or individual person owns the Internet entirely, however there are many organisations that oversee and standardise what happens on the Internet.  </P>

<P>However no one (individual or company) has the power to be able to close down the Internet.</P>

<B><U><P>Where Did The Internet Come From?</P>
</B></U>
<P>Originally the Internet was a child of the defence establishment, evolving from the Arpanet, a research project of the Department of Defence intended to facilitate the sharing of centralised computing facilities by research contractors.  As the amount of users increased ARPANET began to struggle.  Later the National Science Foundation (NSF) developed the NSFNET to aid all research scientists in more generalised, non-proprietary research.  The NSFNET was a big success, it is now in the process of being turned over to the private sector and being looked upon as the basic infrastructure of global communication. The architecture rests largely in the hands of researchers who design the network software.  Access to it is controlled largely by those who own the gateways -- the telecommunications common carriers, the information service providers, the Internet access providers, and the managers of private networks.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><U><P>Where Did The WWW Come From?</P>
</B>
</U><P>The World Wide Web is a network of sites that can be searched and retrieved by a special protocol known as a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The protocol simplified the writing of addresses and automatically searched the Internet for the addresses indicated and automatically called up the document for viewing.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>&#9;</FONT>The WWW concept was designed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and scientists at CERN (Geneva), the European centre for High Energy Physics, who were interested in making it easier to retrieve research documentation.  A year later he had developed a ‘browser/editor’ program and had coined the name World Wide Web as a name for the program.  The program was released for free on the Internet.  This program was a dramatic leap forward from old ‘browser’s’.  </P>

<P>&#9;The next step was to create an improved ‘browser’, a system that allowed the links to be hidden behind text (using a Hypertext Markup Language, HTML) and activated by a click with the ‘mouse’.</P>

<P>&#9;In 1993 Mark Andreesen of NCSA (National Center for SuperComputing Applications, Illinois) launched ‘Mosaic X’.  It was easy to install, easy to use and significantly, backed by 24 hour customer support.  It also enormously improved the graphic capabilities, and included many features that are included in present-day browsers.  </P>

<P>&#9;Mosaic was a runaway hit and by 1994 had been installed on thousands of computers across the globe.  The potential of HTML to create graphically attractive web-sites and the ease with which these web-sites could be accessed through the new generation of web browsers opened the door to whole new groups, no longer just scientists, and the World Wide Web has continued to grow since.</P>

<B><P>Can I Break The Internet?</P>
</B></U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet can be damaged, files can be corrupted, information lost.  However, it would be impossible for one person to destroy the whole Internet.  As the Internet involves world-wide computer connections, to destroy the Internet, every single computer connection, be it directly or indirectly would need to be cut off.  </P>

<LI>&quot;That no one owns the Internet is taken as a truism. But the infrastructure on which the global network runs is owned by a handful of powerful corporations that can, and often do, use their control over the Internet backbone to their advantage in business negotiations. The influence these companies exert, some industry insiders fear, is strangling smaller companies and reducing customer choice.&quot;</LI>

<LI>&quot;No one actually owns the Internet, and no single person or organisation controls the Internet in its entirety. More of a concept than an actual tangible entity, the Internet relies on a physical infrastructure that connects <A HREF="network.html">networks</A> to other networks.&quot;</LI></OL>

<P>3.   &quot;To understand the notion of ownership, one must understand the backbone of the Internet--Domain Name Systems. As the Internet continues to become a larger component of education, teachers need to be aware of the political, commercial, and public influences affecting the Internet.&quot;</P>

</U></FONT><LI> &quot;In addition to using books and magazines to find out about Internet History, why not also use the power of the Internet? The links below will get you started. As you investigate, choose at least 6 of the most important events that led to the Internet as we know it today.&quot;</LI></OL>

<LI> &quot;The United States Military started the Internet in the 1960's. It was used as a computer network for thousands of government employees around the world to communicate. Science and Technology researchers were the first non-military users of the Internet.&quot;</LI></OL>
