<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where Did the Internet Come From?</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is a large computer network linking smaller networks together. It was developed 27 years ago by the United States Department of Defence. The United States military developed the Internet in the 1960’s to enable thousands of government employees to communicate with each other. This early stage of the Internets development stage was know as ARPANET. Its primary goals were to:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>To support military research.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet was a concept that came about as a result of the Cold War. America’s whole computer research capabilities resided in one room and with Russia as a threat could be blown up in one action. So it was decided to decentralise the computer system. This would allow the United States military research to continue, even if there was a loss of one of their machines. This lead to the development of the ARPANET system. Beginning with just three machines the United States scientists began to research ways of transmitting information through a network. In the beginning this exchange of information was limited to user’s holding the same machine and working in the same organisational network. Incorporating the experience of Bolt, Bernard and Newman (BBN), 1968 saw the development of ARPANET. They then began to experiment with the idea of file transfers to a different organisation and machines. Each file was classed as mail and a system developed known as ‘dynamic routing’, enabled the files to be sent and received to different locations on the network. It was designed that the &quot;mail&quot; would choose any available route through the network to reach its destination. If on of the nodes within the network was down the file was programmed to find another available route. This development lead to the expansion of the APARNET creation. It wasn’t until five years later that the creators of ARPANET realised the value of their creation. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More and more smaller users were joining onto the network from different locations on a national level. APARNET allowed every user on the APARNET network to exchange and receive information from other linked users. Every University in the country wanted to join onto this network. With the increasing civilian users plus the purpose of military research APARNET was beginning to strain with such a high capacity of users. This lead to the division of APARNET into two forms:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>MILNET – Military research sites</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>APARNET – Non-military sites, civilian use.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These two networks still remain connect, through the introduction of the INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP). This addition allowed the two networks to exchange information, and for traffic to be route from one system to another accordingly.  Internet protocol allows for more than two networks to be joined together. This division of APARNET paved the way for what the Internet is today. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the United States developed the Internet, its main owners are Trademark owners. It is however run by the NSF. This type of ownership is on a first come first serve basis with no special advantages. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However great the Internet as a creation, it does have its pitfalls. One of those is it is hugely susceptible to falling into a democracy. The Internet poses a potential as being a tool for surveillance, control by those who have access to the same network. Government’s ability to invade the citizens privacy and survey their actions, has greatly increased since the realisation of the internets power.   </P>
