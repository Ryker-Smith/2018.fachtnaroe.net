<P>The Internet started in America in the sixties. The United States government were worried that the Russians were going to attack. They were worried if they attacked they would destroy the computer data. In those days computers were big and they filled a whole room. The Internet used to be called ARPANET this stands for Advanced Research Projects Administration, which is now DARPA the added D is for Defence. The US department of defence set up ARPANET in the late 60’s. ARPANET started out small with 3 computer in California one of which was in Utah. ARPANET soon became widely successful because of this success the every university wanted to sign up. The ARPANET became difficult to manage so it was broken into two parts.</P>

<P>IP = Internet protocol this enables traffic to be routed from one network to another. This also enables people to send electronic mail back and forth to each other. The United States government’s goal was to secure communications between supercomputer labs. They used it to research military missions however in the late 1980’s the Internet was taken over by the National Science Foundation. Their goal was to complete connection between supercomputer sites. Today the Internet is being used everywhere in offices, companies, homes, banks, libraries and schools and general information. The Internet has grown a lot sense the 1960’s. Back in the 1960’s not much people knew bout it but nearly everyone nowadays know what it is and how to use it. The Internet is used nowadays in companies to advertise to anyone that has the Internet by setting up there own web page. They can also send information or important documents to other companies by e-mail this is a much quicker and safer way then sending letters back and forth between companies. To have the Internet you need the following equipment</P>

The Internet can also be a benefit to children it can be educational if used right. Parents can check on sites that their children have been on. Many schools nowadays have computers with the Internet on them. To Encourage students to use it to there benefit. The Internet has a home page which is the very first page you see when you go on the Internet this has sometimes as a calendar and a few other useful tools. Sometimes when people don’t have a web site address to look up something they use search engines to find something they just type in what they are looking for and a few different web sites show up then all you have to do is click on one of them.     </P>

<P>A government, machine or big organisation runs the Internet no one person owns the Internet.</P>
