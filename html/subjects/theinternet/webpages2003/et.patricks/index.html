<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">What is the Internet?</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is a network of computers and Net related applications connected to each other using phone lines and Wireless applications. The Internet reaches from the computer to the phone line through a modem. A modem converts digital signals from the computer analogue signals which can then be sent through the telephone line to other networks and computers which have modems to convert the signal back to digital again.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">                             The Internet is used to access files on show by other file sharing computers. This was so until the mid nineties when the Net took on many purposes.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">How did the Internet come to be?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early 1960s the United States Defence Department needed a way to share files between their different computers in a secure way. This network also had to be able to survive nuclear attack, as the US were engaged in the cold war with the Russians.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">                             In 1969 the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was set up. This agency set up a computer network, which met the needs of the government defence department. This was called the Arpanet, which networked four different computers to each other.  There were many other types of networks after this the most famous being the Internet, but other networks of that time were MILNET NSFNET AND USNET being some others.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Who owns the Internet?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</FONT><P>Any individual or company does not own the Internet. The Internet was originally designed for defence purposes as stated above. It was later used for educational purposes linking colleges around the US. When the cold war ended the Internet became more widely available. The internet is funded by governments across the world and is kept running by the individuals who are on-line through hubs which are large modems which allow internet traffic to travel through .The Internet is free to use all you need is a computer and a modem. The only costs paid using the Internet are phone bills.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Where did the World Wide Web come From?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</FONT><P>Tim Berners-Lee designed the WWW concept in 1989. He was a scientist at CERN Geneva. He was interested making easier ways to retrieve files from other computers. In 1990 he designed a browser which became the World Wide Web.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Who Makes the Internet Work?</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people who make the Internet work are those who use it. The Internet itself is a co-operative self-organising, community of file-sharing, public collaboration based on mutual trust. Nobody owns or is charge of it. However, there are a number of dedicated volunteer groups who keeps the Internet working through their efforts at standards development. These include the Internet Society, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), ICANN, Commercial Internet Exchange Association (CIX) and CommerceNet.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Can I break the Internet?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</FONT><P>The Internet cannot be broken. It was designed in such a way by the us Defence Department that it would survive nuclear attack. If one of the links was broken the internet traffic would be re-routed through  a different system.</P>
