  <p><b>Who Owns the ‘Internet'?</b></p>
  </B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we can begin to solve the question of who owns the Internet I feel that we must first understand what the Internet is, and where it all began. </P>

  <p><b>Where did 'The Internet' come from?</b></p>
  <P>The idea of networking computers was first published in August of 1962 by Joseph Licklider and Wesley Clark. Licklider would later become the first head of computer research at ARPA, a name that is synonymous with the History of the Internet.</P>
  <P>In 1968 ARPA contracted BBN to build the ARPANET (packet switched network) and by December 1969 a physical network was constructed linking four nodes, The University of California in Los Angeles, SRI in Stanford, The University of California in Santa Barbara and the University of Utah. The Internet or ARPANET was beginning to take shape. Email and TCP/IP (the protocol for the transfer of information over the Internet) were soon to follow.</P>

  <p><b>What is the Internet?</b></p>
  <P>‘The Internet is a global network, connecting millions of computers in more than 100 countries into exchanges of data, news and opinions’. There is a lot of technology behind the internet, but it cannot be explained in a short document. Put simply, the worlds computers are hooked together, and can talk to one another.</P>
  <P>There is no home of the Internet or a master computer. Just lots of computers all over the world with lots of information all hooked together. If you have access to the Internet, you can read, hear, view and interact all this information from your own computer. </P>
  <P>The Internet is <B>not</B> synonymous with World Wide Web.</P>

  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
  <p>Looking at the above information I believe that no one person, company or government own the internet, only company’s that define common standards so it can work more efficiently. </P>

  <P>I believe that anyone who contributes to the Internet by creating web sites, hosting web sites, using forums and even just using the Internet in general, all can claim a piece of the Internet. If nobody build web sites would we have the World Wide Web? If nobody used email, ftp or any of the many other utilities the Internet provides, would there be an Internet? I’m sure big computer companys would still use the internet for communicating with employees and such, but it wouldn’t be the internet as we know it.</P>
