</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A lot of people who use the Internet often ask the question "who owns the Internet?" people who work with computers know the answer to this question. The answer is in fact that no one person owns the Internet although the Internet was "Made in the U.S.A.," its unique design transformed into a resource innovation that anyone in the world could use. Today, however courts and corporations are attempting to wall of cyberspace. In doing so they are destroying the Internet’s potential to foster economic growth worldwide.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet revolution has ended just as quickly as it begun. Nobody expected the explosion of creativity that the network produced but at the same time people didn’t expect the phenomenon to collapse as quickly as it started. At the start the Internet was a place of freedom where people could explore without corporations blocking what they could see or do. But when the Internet became a world-wide phenomenon the big corporations saw this potential as a way of making more money so they bought as much shares as they could so they could advertise there company and products and could restrict what people could do.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After time people begun to ask who makes the Internet because with corporations and governments owing bits of the Internet people begun to wonder who runs it but again the answer is that no one person makes the Internet work. The Internet is a loose amalgamation of computer networks run by many different organisations in over seventy countries. Not only do different organisations makes the Internet work but so Universities because they hold a huge stake in the Internet they collaborative research and digital library’s these are just a few examples stake in the Internet. Governments also have a say in decision-making regarding the Internet US agencies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Science Foundation (NSF) are just some US agencies the also have a say in decision-making of the Internet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With all these people owing bits of the Internet people wondered who made the decisions about the Internet and what to put on to it and how to protect young people who use the Internet. No one person can make this decision so most of the technological decisions are made by small committees of volunteers who set the standards for interoperability so in fact the Internet is a Democracy because people vote on what to put on the Internet. This is better because if one person decided then they would own the Internet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Younger people of today who often wonder where did The Internet come from, it started in the late 1960s and developed in the late 1970s to allow the US government and university researchers to share information. But is was not till the late 1980s that Internet begun to be used widely and as it was then and as it is now no one person owns the Internet.</P>
