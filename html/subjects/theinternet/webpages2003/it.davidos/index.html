</FONT><P>Where Did The Internet Come From?</P>
</B>
<P>It all began in the USA in 1968, when a company called Bolt Beranek and Newman were hired by the United States Defence Department to develop a communications network called ARPANET.This system was the precursor to the Internet. A man by the name of Ray Tomlinson created the first e-mail to be sent between two computers in 1971. Then in 1973 the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated a research program to find ways of interlinking different networks with each other.</P>

<P>The aim was to develop communication protocols, which would allow networked computers to communicate across multiple, linked networks. This was called the Interneting Project and the system that resulted was called the Internet. The system of protocols developed during this research were the TCP/IP Protocol Suite, after the two initial protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).</P>

<P>The US National Science Foundation (NSF) developed NSFNET  in 1986, which today provides a major backbone communication service for the Internet. Others providing backbone services include, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US Department of Energy. In Europe, major international backbones such as NORDUNET provide services to thousands of computers on a large number of networks.</P>

<P>Today the Internet is part of every-day life, the bulk of the system being used for private networking by education and research institutions, businesses and government organisations across the globe. With the development of new technology, the Internet is being made available to more and more users throughout the world</P>

<B><P>Who Owns The Internet?</P>

</B><P>No single individual person or company owns the Internet. The Internet relies on a physical infrastructure that connects networks to other networks. There are many organisations, corporations, governments, schools, private citizens and service providers that all own pieces of the infrastructure, but there is no one body that owns it. There are, however, organisations that oversee and standardise what happens on the Internet, e.g. the National Science Foundation and the Internet Architecture Board. </P>

<B><P>Where Did The World Wide Web Come From?</P>
<P> </P>
</B><P>The WWW concept was designed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and scientists at CERN (Geneva), the European centre for High Energy Physics, who were interested in making easier to retrieve research documentation. A year later he had developed a 'browser/editor' program and had coined the name World Wide Web as a name for the program. </P>
