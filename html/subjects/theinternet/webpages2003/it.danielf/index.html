<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1973, the US, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated a research program to investigate techniques and technologies for interlinking packet networks of various kinds. The objective was to develop communication protocols which would allow networked computers to communicate transparently across, linked packet networks. This was called the Internetting project and the system of networks which emerged from the research was known as the "Internet." The system of protocols which was developed over the course of this research effort became known as the TCP/IP Protocol Suite, after the two initial protocols developed: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1986, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) initiated the development of the NSFNET which, today, provides a major backbone communication service for the Internet. With its 45 megabit per second facilities, the NSFNET carries on the order of 12 billion packets per month between the networks it links. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Energy contributed additional backbone facilities in the form of the NSINET and ESNET respectively. In Europe, major international backbones such as NORDUNET and others provide connectivity to over one hundred thousand computers on a large number of networks. Commercial network providers in the U.S. and Europe are beginning to offer Internet backbone and access support on a competitive basis to any interested parties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various consortium networks provide "Regional" support for the Internet and "local" support is provided through each of the research and educational institutions. Within the United States, much of this support has come from the federal and state governments, but a considerable contribution has been made by industry. In Europe and elsewhere, support arises from co-operative international efforts and through national research organisations. During the course of its evolution, particularly after 1989, the Internet system began to integrate support for other protocol suites into its basic networking fabric. The present emphasis in the system is on multi-protocol inter-working, and in particular, with the integration of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocols into the architecture.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both public domain and commercial implementations of the roughly 100 protocols of TCP/IP protocol suite became available in the 1080's. During the early 1990's, OSI protocol implementations also became available and, by the end of 1991, the Internet has grown to include some 5,000 networks in over three dozen countries, serving over 700,000 host computers used by over 4,000,000 people.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A great deal of support for the Internet community has come from the U.S. Federal Government, since the Internet was originally part of a federally-funded research program and, subsequently, has become a major part of the U.S. research infrastructure. During the late 1980's, the population of Internet users and network constituents expanded internationally and began to include commercial facilities. Indeed, the bulk of the system today is made up of private networking facilities in educational and research institutions, business and in government organisations across the globe. Over its fifteen-year history, the Internet has functioned as collaboration among co-operating parties. Certain key functions have been critical for its operation, not the least of which is the specification of the protocols by which the components of the system operate. These were originally developed in the DARPA research program mentioned above, but in the last five or six years, this work has been undertaken on a wider basis with support from Government agencies Board (IAB) was created in 1983 to guide the community. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the course of its existence, the IAB has reorganised several times. It now has two primary components: the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Internet Research Task Force. The former has primary responsibility for further evolution of the TCP/IP protocol suite, its standardisation with the concurrence of the LAB, and the integration of other protocols into Internet operation (e.g. the Open Systems Interconnection protocols). The Internet Research Task Force continues to organise and explore advanced concepts in networking under the guidance of the Internet Activities Board and with support from various government agencies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recording of identifiers is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) who has delegated one part of this responsibility to an Internet Registry. This registry acts as a central repository for Internet information, and provides central allocation of network and autonomous system identifiers, in some cases to subsidiary registries located in your various countries. The Internet Registry (IR) also provides central maintenance of the Domain Name System (DNS) root database which points to subsidiary distributed DNS servers replicated throughout the Internet. The DNS distributed database is used, to associate host and network names with their Internet addresses and is critical to the operation of the higher level TCP/IP protocols including electronic mail.</P>
