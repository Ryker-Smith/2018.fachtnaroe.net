<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where did the Internet Come From?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the sixties the U.S. government feared that if the U.S.S.R. could pinpoint their main computer system, it would be possible for them to strategically place an atomic bomb and destroy the whole operation.  This caused them to launch an aggressive military campaign.  They created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) within the Ministry of Defence.  This was the U.S. government’s research agency for all space and strategic missile research.  After the formation of NASA, the activities of ARPA moved away from aeronautics and focused mainly on computer science and information processing.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1966/67 the head of computer research, Leonard Roberts, published a plan for a computer network system called APRANET.  Ideas were developed further and in October 1969 an experiment was carried out to put the theory of wide area networks into action.   Computers were installed a both UCLA and Stanford.  UCLA students would ‘login’ to Stanford’s computer, access its databases and try to send data.  The experiment proved to be a success and by December 1969 APRANET comprised of four host computers.  More and more computers were connected to the APRANET network and things grew.  APRANET then became known as the Internet.  Other networks from different countries joined on and the size of the Internet shot up.  In 1969 there were four computers connected.  Twenty years later, in 1989, there were 160,000.  Last July there were 6.5 million and in the last six months this figure has increased to 9.5 million.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where did the World Wide Web Come From?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet made the development of the World Wide Web possible.  This is a network of sites that can be searched and retrieved by a special protocol known as Hypertext Transfer protocol (HTTP). This concept was designed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and scientists at CERN (Geneva), the European centre for High Energy Physics, who were interested in making it easier to retrieve research documentation.  On the Internet you find a network of computers.  On the Web you find information.  The connections between computers are cables on the Internet.  On the Web they are hypertext links.  The Web and the Internet are dependent on eachother.  The Web would not be in existence without the Internet.  The Internet is more useful with the Web because people are interested in accessing information.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who Owns the Internet?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With 9.5 million consumers, one would come to the conclusion that the Internet must be an extremely profitable network.  This causes one to pose the question &quot;Who actually owns the Internet?&quot;.  The answer is nobody.  No single person or organisation has control over the entire Internet.  However, the infrastructure on which the network runs is owned by a handful of powerful corporations.  Most of this power is based in the U.S.  The other possible candidates for ownership are the major software companies, those professionals who can manipulate the software and advertisers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who Makes the Internet Work?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people who make the Internet work are those who use it.  The Internet itself is a self-organising, adaptive, many-to-many, peer-to-peer international file-sharing, public collaboration based on human goodwill.  Nobody is in charge of it.  However, there are a number of dedicated volunteer groups who keeps the Internet working through their efforts at standards development.  These include the Internet Society, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), ICANN, Commercial Internet Exchange Association (CIX) and CommerceNet.</P>
