</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Where did the Internet come from?</P>
</B></FONT><P>The Internet consists of a global network of computers with millions of users who communicate via the telephone line. The original birth of this global network which was known then as Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) took place in 1957 in the Untied States within the Department of Defense. This was originally a project designed for this department. It was a military research network that would be used to maintain command and control over U.S. bombers and missiles in the event of an attack.</P>

<P>The RAND Corporation a government agency in the U.S. proposed a packet switched network. This enabled data to be sent from computer to computer. The data would be labelled to indicate its origin and destination.</P>
<P>Shortly afterwards, in 1972 the first e-mail program was created by Ray Tomlinson the Advanced Research Projects Agency was renamed The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).</P>

<P>From 1972 until the 80’s the Arpanet continued to grow. Between these year’s the public become in contact with the Arpanet for the first time in 1982.</P>

<P>In 1988, traffic on the Internet increased so quickly that plans immediately began on upgrading the network.</P>

<P>In 1990 Merit, IBM and MCI formed a non-profit making corporation called Advanced Network and Services (ANS) which aimed to conduct research into high-speed networking. Also, during 1990 the Department of Defense decommissioned the Arpanet. This changed the way the Internet was used and made it what it is today – a public network. In 1989 there were more than 160,000 computers connected. The Internet as we know it today is the open interconnection of computer networks that allows computers and programmes to communicate directly.</P>

</B><P>No one single person owns the Internet. There are many organisations, corporations, governments, schools, private citizens and service providers that all own pieces of the infrastructure but there is no one bodies that owns it all. There are organisations that oversee and standardise what happens on the Internet. </P>

</B><P>A computer scientist called Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1990 made the first proposal for such a system at CERN. This was originally invented and developed as a tool for the large high-energy physics collaborations which have a demand for instantaneous information for physicists working in different universities all over the world. From there it has spread rapidly to other fields and grew to its present impressive size.</P>

<P>The end of 1990 was already demonstrating prototype software for basic system. To encourage the adoption of the system, it was essential to offer access to existing information without having to convert it to an unfamiliar format. </P>
<P>All this information immediately became accessible via a simple WWW browser, which could run on any system. Now it has millions of academic and commercial users.</P>
