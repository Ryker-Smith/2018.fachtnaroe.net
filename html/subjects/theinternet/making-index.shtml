<h1>Saving Your Webpage for 'The Internet' module</h1>

<h2>Why Am I doing this?</h2>
<p>The third assignment must be submitted in paper form as well as submitted in electronic form as a web page. Read this page <i>before</i> the class.</p>
<h2>What am I doing?</h2>
Most web pages are saved in HTML format. Some others are saved in PDF format. Both are quite different formats but do have the common aim of universal readability. However, HTML is in plain text and can <i>do things</i>, while PDF aims primarily just to be universally readable and only more advanced versions try to <i>do</i> anything.
<ul>
<li>HTML = "Hyper Text Markup Language"</li>
<li>PDF = "Portable Document Format"</li>
</ul>
Luckily you can use OpenOffice.org to easily create both document types. For PDF just use the 'Export Directly As PDF' button (hard, eh?) which you have already used for certain on-line submissions. For HTML suitable for web use, use the <b>Save As...</b> option.
<h2>Where am I doing it?</h2>
In your (remote) home folder on our Linux server (where there is a subfolder called <b>public_html</b>) save the file as <b>historyandstructure.html</b>. (Under Linux public_html is for exactly what it's name implies. It is where you can create and post files that you wish to be accessible by others using the internet). Once you have a file called <b>index.html</b> - which is the first file looked for in a web directory - this should appear when users type:
<b><center>https://webmail.fachtnaroe.net/~<i>your_username/</i></center></b>
<h2>How do I do it?</h2>
Create your assignment as a normal paper essay. Then copy the text into <b>gedit</b>, edit the text to have appropriate HTML tags (click here for more information), save the marked-up document;  navigate to the correct drive or folder and ensure that the file is called <b>historyandstructure.html</b> before pressing save. We're calling this file historyandstructure.html because 1) that's what it's about and 2) we need the name index.html to be available for your Web Authoring project. Nearly done.
<h2>Putting it on the web</h2>
If you're working directly on a Linux system the file is probably already world-readable on the Internet and you're already finished. Under Windows, unless some special magic has been employed, you now have to copy the file to it's destination from your network drive using FTP. Depending on your Linux arrangements you may also have to use FTP.
<h2>FTP?</h2>
For Windows download a suitable FTP client if one isn't already installed. Under Linux use FileZilla (install it as root if it's not already available). Our remote server already contains an FTP server that you can connect to. Give the name of the remote (other) computer: <b>webmail.fachtnaroe.net</b>, your username and password to the FTP client and click on connect. Well, almost.
If the FTP client reccommended in the help section doesn't work try another one - there's plenty of free ones out there.
Also, normally that's all that is required; FTP communcates on ports 21 and 20. Secure FTP (SFTP) is normally on port 22 like SSH access. On our system that port has been moved, so you will need to use the alternate port specified to you orally or by email to make your connection. You'll also have to specify that it's an SSH connection. (Normally, all traffic to and from <b>webmail.fachtnaroe.net</b> is encrypted).
When a connection is established you should find two 'panes' in your Window. One shows the remote (other) computer and the other shows the local (your) computer. You can then move files between these 'panes' which each represent the local and remote computers.
<h2>How do I check my submission?</h2>
Go <b><a href="http://www.fachtnaroe.com/subjects/theinternet/#present">here</a></b> and look for your name.
