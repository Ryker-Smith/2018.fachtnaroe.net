</B></FONT><P>The Internet began in 1957 and is continued on to today, growing stronger and stronger everyday.  What is the structure of the Internet?  There are three levels of the Internet of the US portion.  On the bottom level there are local area networks.  A backbone is one network which many other networks connect to.  The middle levels connect to the backbone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Who exactly runs the Internet?  The answer to this frequently asked question is "no one".  The Internet is a loose amalgamation of computer networks run by many different organisations in over seventy countries.  Small committees of volunteers make most of the decisions regarding the technological side.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From my experience of using the Internet, many people are not aware of it until they reach secondary school or college, where they have free access to computers.  But nowadays where National schools have a computer, it gives the younger generation a great insight to the future.  It has only taken over the world recently.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Internet is expanding everyday.  It ranges from the most simplistic thing, for example, how alcohol works, or how video games work to more detailed and complicated things like Internal Web Systems or Software Test Engineer.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Internet now entertains people who want to advertise job offers, this has come along way from radios or newspapers, for example, on one of the sights it shows how to get a job at Google, why would you want a job at Google or the different jobs available at Google.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It states in my Research Document that the original creators of the Internet were scientists.  Scientists tend not to take 'political' views of things; instead they will tend to think in terms of right and wrong.  As we are all aware there are as many rights as there is wrongs with the Internet, for example, regarding e-mail etc, as can be read from my other assignment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What would we do without the Internet today?  If the Internet was gone tomorrow, I can imagine the huge loss it would be because of the huge dependence on it today.</P></BODY>
