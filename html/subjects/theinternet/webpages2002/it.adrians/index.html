<P>The first description of the social interaction that could be enabled through networking were memos in August 1962 by a fellow called J.C.R Licklider. He described his Galactic Network and envisioned a globally interconnect set of computers through which everyone could access data and programs from any site the user entered. Networking really started from this point in October 1962.</P>

<P>The Internet is a Global Network. It is like towns in a way. As the Internet has similar services to that of a town. When you send an e-mail to some at the other side of the world, the e-mail is send to an electronic post box before being sent to the destination allocated. Libraries are available on -line all times of the day which you then have access to millions of book world-wide. The Internet allows you to book tickets, order food, chat rooms, watch TV and movie releases, listen to radio stations etc. .In the world today you can travel to by car to destination via different ways, it is the same using the Internet as network lets you go to your destination also.</P>

<P>While using the Internet there is alot of communicating going on between computers at the same time. You use different software and programs to accomplish different tasks such as the following: a Web Browser for shopping sites and an E-mail program to send and receive E-mails. </P>

<P>Some programs contain more than one program to do different tasks. Netscape Communicator has three program in one which are Netscape Navigator an E-mail program and a Newsreader.</P>
<P>Eudora is a more specialised piece of software. It is a stand-alone E-mail program, which can be combined with other programs and other software into a system that work s for you. </P>
