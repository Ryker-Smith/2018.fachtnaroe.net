<P>The History and Structure of the Internet</P>
</U><P>&nbsp;The original birthplace of the Internet was the United States Department of Defence. It was known then as the Arpanet (Advanced Research Projects Agency – ARPA). It involved a network of 4 computers at different locations throughout the U.S. and was originally designed to allow scientists to share data and to access remote computers. It was a decentralised military research network. It would be used to maintain command and control over U.S. bombers and missiles in the event of a nuclear attack. The decentralisation enabled the military to maintain control over nuclear arms if any of the 4 locations were attacked.</P>
<P>The information was sent via a packet switched network. Using this system, data is sent from computer to computer and labelled to indicate its origin and destination.</P>
<P>In 1969 the first hosts (4 Universities) are linked. E-mail quickly becomes the most popular application – used to discuss and collaborate research projects and topics of interest.</P>
<P>Between 1974-1981 The Arpanet continues to grow and gradually begins to move away from its military and research roots. The commercial version of the Arpanet goes on-line, giving the general public get a first glimpse of how computer networking can be used in daily life. Growth continues and in 1982 the term Internet is used for the first time. A common language of all Internet computers is developed and the Internet as we know it today is born.</P>
<P>During the mid 80’s many companies joined the Internet for the first time. Corporations begin using it to communicate with each other and with their customers.</P>
<P>By 1988 the Internet is an essential tool for communications but concerns about privacy and security begin to arise. On 1 November 1988 this concern becomes a reality when a programme called the "Internet Worm" temporarily disables 6,000 of the 60,000 host computers. As a result the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) is formed, to address such security issues. </P>
<P>By 1989 there are more than 100,000 Internet hosts and in 1990 the Arpanet is decommissioned, leaving behind the network of over 300,000 hosts which it has become – THE INTERNET. </P>
<P>&nbsp;The Internet as we know it today is the open interconnection of computer networks that enables computers and the programmes they run to communicate directly.</P>
<P>The term Internet/Net is usuaally applied to the global, publicly accessible network.</P>
<P>Information travels across computer networks via the Internet backbone. The backbone contains the links that provide the main connections between its connected networks.</P>
<P>A computer connected to a network is called an Internet host. This host is provided with a unique number; an Internet Protocol (IP) address. The Domain Name Service (DNS) gives a name to this address e.g. microsoft.com – com refers to a commercial organisation.</P>
<P>Many kinds of networks and services are connected via systems called gateways.</P>
<P>E-mail (electronic mail) allows a message to be sent from one person to another, or to many others, via computer.</P>
<P>The World Wide Web offers vast amounts of easily accessible information across the Internet.</P></BODY>
