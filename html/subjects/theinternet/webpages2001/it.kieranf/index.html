<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>&quot;The History and structure of the Internet&quot;</P>
<P>  </B></FONT>Kieran Fahey.</P>

<P>During the 60's, this intriguing concept of a decentralised, blastproof, packet-switching network was kicked around by RAND, MIT and UCLA. The National Physical Laboratory in Great Britain set up the first test network on these principles in 1968.</P>
<P>Shortly afterward, the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency decided to fund a larger, more ambitious project in the USA. The nodes of the network were to be high-speed supercomputers (or what passed for supercomputers at the time). These were rare and valuable machines which were in real need of good solid networking, for the sake of National research-and-development projects.</P>

<P>In Fall 1969, the first such node was installed in UCLA. By December 1969, there were four nodes on the infant network, which was named ARPANET, after its Pentagon sponsor. The four computers could transfert data on dedicated high-speed transmission lines. They could even be programmed remotely from the other nodes. Thanks to ARPANET scientists and researchers could now share one another's computer facilities by long-distance. This was a very handy service, for computer time was precious in the 70's. In 1971 there was fifteen nodes in ARPANET; by 1972, thirty-seven nodes. And it was good.</P>

<P>By the second year of operation, however, an odd fact became clear. ARPANET'S users had warped the computer- sharing network into a dedicated, high-speed, federally subsidised electronic post office. The main traffic on ARPANET was not long-distance computing. Instead , it was news and personal messages. Researchers were using ARPANET to collaborate on projects, to trade notes on work, and eventually to downright gossip. People had their own personal accounts on the ARPANET computers, and their own personal addresses for electronic mail. It wasn't long before the invention of the mailing list, an ARPANET broadcasting technique in which an identical message could be sent automatically to large numbers of network subscribers.</P>
<P>Interestingly, one of the first really big mailing lists was "sf-lovers", for science fiction lovers. Discussing science fiction on the network was not work-related and was frowned upon by many ARPANET computer administrators, but this didn't stop it from happening. The Internet doesn’t charge much per minute over long distance calls.</P>

<P>The ARPA’s original standard for communication was known as NCP, &quot;Network Control Protocol,&quot;  but as time passed and technique advanced, NCP was superceded by  a higher-level, more sophisticated standard known as TCP/IP. TCP converts messages into streams of packets at the source, then reassembles them back into messages at the destination. IP handles the addressing, seeing to it that packets are routed across multiple nodes and even across multiple networks with multiple standards – not only ARPA’s pioneering NCP standard, but others like ethernet, FDDI, and X.25.</P>
<P>As early as 1977, TCP/IP was being used by other networks to link to ARPANET. ARPANET itself remained fairly tightly controlled, at least until 1983. When its military segment broke off and became Milnet. But TCP/IP linked them all. ARPANET itself though it was growing became a smaller and smaller neighbourhood amid the vastly growing galaxy of other linked machines. As the ‘70’s and ‘80’s advanced many very different social groups found themselves in possession of powerful computers. It was fairly easy to link these computers to the network-of-networks. As the use of TCP/IP became more popular, entire other networks fell into the Digital embrace of the Internet, and messily adhered. Since the software called TCP/IP was public-domain, and the basic technology was decentralised and rather anarchic by its very nature. It was difficult to stop people from barging in and joining somewhere or other. In point of fact nobody wanted to stop them from joining this branching complex of networks, which came to be known as the &quot;Internet&quot;.</P>
<P>Connecting to the Internet cost the taxpayer little or nothing since each node was independent, and had to handle its own financing and its own technical requirements. The more, the merrier. Like the phone network, The computer network became more valuable.</P>

<P>Why do people want to be on the &quot;Internet&quot;? One of the main reasons is simple freedom. The internet is a rare example  of a true, modern, functional anarchy. There is no &quot;Internet INC. there are no official censors, no bosses, no board of Directors, no stockholders. In principal , any node can speak as a peer to any other node, as long as it obeys the rules of the TCP/IP protocols, which are strictly technical not political or social. ( There has been some struggle over commercial use of the internet, but that situation is changing as businesses supply their own links). The internet is also a bargain. The internet as a whole unlike the phone system , doesn’t charge for long-distance service. And unlike most commercial computer networks it doesn’t charge for access time either. In fact the internet itself which doesn’t even exist as an entity, never charges for anything. Each group of people accessing the Internet is responsible for their own machine and their own section of line.  </P>
