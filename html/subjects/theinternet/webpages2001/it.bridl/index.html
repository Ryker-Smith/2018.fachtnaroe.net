<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is one of the greatest inventions. The Internet effects the majority of the Public in some form or another. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1945 Vannevar Bush wrote an article in Atlantic Monthly about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first recording of the social interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962. He had a theory called the "Galactic Network". His concept consisted of a set of interconnected computers through which everyone could access data and programs from any site. He was the head of the first computer research program at DARPA. While he was there he convinced his successors Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawernce G. Roberts, of the importance of this networking concept.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1965 Lawrence G Roberts and Thomas Merrill connected the TX-2 computer in mass to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first wide-area computer network ever built. The result of this was that time-shared computers could work well together. The switch telephone system was inadequate for the job</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and put together his plan for the "ARPANET". He published it in 1967.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Computers were added to the ARPANET during the following years, and work continued on completing a functionally complete Host-to-Host protocol and other network software. In December 1970 the Network Working Group (NWG). As the ARPANET sites completed implementing NCP during the period 1971 - 1972.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 1972 Bob Kahn organised a demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC). This was the first public demonstration of this new network technology to the public. It was also in 1972 that the initial "hot" application, electronic mail, was first set up. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email message send and read software. The ARPANET developers for an easy co-ordination mechanism needed this. In July, Roberts expanded its utility by writing the first email utility programs to list, selectively read, file, forward, and respond to messages. From there email took off as the largest network application for over a decade. </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">Structure</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Controlled by the Internet Engineering Task Force. Working groups discuss specific issues. All standards are open and publicly available, proprietary solutions are a threat to open standards. Changes occur slowly because of its size, global organisations more slowly. The Internet has not finished changing.</P>
