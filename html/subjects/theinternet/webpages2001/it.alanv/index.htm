<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">A Brief History of the Internet</P>
</FONT>
<P>The U.S. Department of Defence laid the foundation of the Internet roughly 30 years ago with a network called ARPANET. But the general public didn't use the Internet much until after the development of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s. As</P>
<P>recently as June 1993, there were only 130 Web sites. Now there are millions. Here's a quick look at how it all came to be.</P>

<B><P>The beginnings: ARPANET</P>
</B>
<P>In 1957, the U.S. government formed the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a segment of the Department of Defence charged with ensuring U.S. leadership in science and technology with military applications. In 1969, ARPA</P>
<P>Established ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet. </P>

<B><P>Research and education </P>
</B>
<P>ARPANET was a network that connected major computers at the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa Barbara, Stanford Research Institute, and the University of Utah. Within a couple of years, several other</P>
<P>educational and research institutions joined the network. </P>

<P>In response to the threat of nuclear attack, ARPANET was designed to allow continued communication if one or more sites were destroyed. Unlike today, when millions of people have access to the Internet from home, work, or their public</P>
<P>library, ARPANET served only computer professionals, engineers, and scientists who knew their way around its complex workings. </P>

<B><P>Evolution </P>
</B>
<P>Throughout the 1970s, developers created the protocols used to transfer information over the Internet. By the early 1980s, Usenet newsgroups and electronic mail had been born. Most users were affiliated with universities, although libraries began</P>
<P>to connect their catalogues to the Internet, too. During the late 1980s, developers created indices, such as Archie and the Wide Area Information Server (WAIS), to keep track of the information on the Internet. To give users a friendly, easy-to-use interface to work with, the University of Minnesota created its Gopher, a simple menu system for accessing files, in 1991. </P>
