</FONT><P>The Internet is a huge collection of computers sited around the world and connected together to form a huge network allowing information to be collated and shared by many millions of people. The idea of the Net is not a new one, having been originally planned in the early 1960s by the American military as a way of preserving communications in the event of a nuclear war. &Igrave;n 1973, the U.S. Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated a research program to investigate the techniques and technologies for interlinking packet networks of various kinds. The objective was to develop communication protocols which would allow networked computers to communicate transparently across multiple, linked packet networks. The system of protocols which was developed became known as the TCP/IP Protocol suite, after the two initial protocols developed: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>However, as time has passed, the original network of a handful of computers in the U.S. expanded rapidly as universities and scientists realised it was a unique way of passing shared knowledge and research work. Through the 1970s and early 80s the popularity of the Internet grew exponentially as the educational establishment clamoured to sign up for the on-line experience and enterprising entrepreneurs realised there was great potential in selling Internet Access into the home. Having achieved massive success in the U.S. the Net was to enjoy a second wind of popularity when the U.K. and Europe cottoned onto its potential in the mid 1980s.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In reality the Net is a huge collection of networks connected together using special protocols and specialise computers called routers. Each of the smaller networks is registered with these routers which contain huge lists of data which allow them to pass data easily between them. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In order to get connected to the Internet, the hardware required will be; a modem, a phone line and of course a PC, the software required is TCP/IP, a browser, and an email client, an ISP is also required (Internet Service Provider). </P>
