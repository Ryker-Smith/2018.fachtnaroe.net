<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">History and structure of the Internet</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet was set up about 30 years ago. It was set up by the U.S Department of Defence it was then called the ARPANET.  At that time the general public did not use the Internet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of the Internet began during the Cold War in 1969.  It was researched by the US military and Universities to investigate its effectiveness and survival – should a nuclear attack occur.  It proved to be a very convenient way to communicate and continued to be used by the Government Department, Universities and Companies.  It gradually developed over two decades’s form an E-mail facility to a network that was able to send date back and forth. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1990 graphic information and test developed on the Internet, commonly known as a web site and that was our first introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW).  This facility opened a wide range of information and therefor attracted a variety of new net users, both for personal and business use.  No one authority controls the Web.  To make the Internet it requires TCP/IP is also requires ISP (Internet Service Provider) for e.g. Eircom.  Computers are identified by numbers, they cannot handle names. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an IP address with every computer.  Search engines overcome the vastness of the Net, the technology is new, but it is still just a library, learn the rules for one of more search engines, and you can use them all.  An example of a search engine would be Yahoo or Alta Vista. When you are searching for information on the Internet you will need an Domain Name server for example http://www. Yahoo .Com most ISPs will provide standard e-mail address.  </P>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is a network of computer networks connected together which pass data among and within each other using special protocols.  Within each network, different computers and designed to handle certain types of data, and we identify these computers according to these functions.  All computers in the Internet have a unique host name.  Technically a ‘host name’ is just a name given to a computer.  But in order for this computer to be recognised by other Internet computers, it needs to be given an Internet Protocol (IP) address. These addresses are controlled by the IANA, ACANN and each individual country.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to result, the Internet contains over 800 million pages of accessible information.  It would be impossible to list everything in a bibliography.  Subject directories are organised indexes of subject categories that allow the user to browse through a list of web sites by subject in search of information.  Subject directories are complied and maintained by humans.  Even though searching with a directory may produce fewer result than an engine, the information tends to be more relevant providing links to sites that are not out of context.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Internet growth has been fueled by individual users with modem-equipped personal computers.  Most of them subscribe to local networks that provide a connection to the wider Internet.  Many individuals, as well as businesses, create their own &quot;home pages&quot; – points of access that allow anyone on the Internet to view and download information.  Internet growth has been fueled  by the development of the World Wide Web: a collection of thousands of independently owned computers.</P></BODY>
