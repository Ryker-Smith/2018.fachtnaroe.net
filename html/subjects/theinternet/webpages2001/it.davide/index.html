</B></FONT><P>The Internet first became available for public use in 1995, although the standards were always public. It first grew out of USA defence and research requirements. It was a network designed to withstand failures and this included nuclear attacks. The growth of the Internet is now driven by consumer interest.  It is a very big business today and the Internet is used globally on a daily basis. It is used for a number of different reasons by people. People can purchase goods that vary from clothes, to books and cars also. It is possible now to buy anything now just by clicking on it. That will give you an idea just what the Internet is about in today’s world. To get connected to it from home you need a PC, a phone line and a modem. There are multiple independent netwotks involved and they all follow the same rules. I wonder do the people who thought up of the idea of creating the ‘Net have any idea that in today’s world that this would be as huge and as used as it is. It was originally the brainchild of Paul Baran back in the 1950’s. It was felt that after the Cold War America would need a coomand-and-control network working from city to city, by way of linking them was introduced. However, no matter how thoroughly the network was armoured the switches and wiring would be vulnerable to the impact of atomic bombs. </P>

<P>The RAND Corporation were the people involved in the Internet’s birth and Paul Baran was a staffer within the Corporation. They introduced a proposal and this was made public in 1964. It was decided that the network would have no central authority. Also, it would be designed from the beginning to operate while in tatters. It’s principles were simple. The network would assume to be unreliable all the time. The particular route that the packet took would be unimportant. The only thing that mattered would be the final result. The packet would be thrown node to node more or less in the direction of its destination, until it ended up in the proper place. This system would prove to be extremely rugged. In 1968, in Great Britian, The National Physical Laboratory set up the first test network on these principles. After this, the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency funded a larger and more ambitious project in America. The nodes they were using would be high-speed supercomputers of that time. They were valuable machines and they needed good solid networking for the sake of national research projects.</P>

<P>Later in 1969 the first node was installed in UCLA. There were four nodes on the infant network, which they named ARPANET after its Pentagon sponsor. The four computers could transfer data on dedicated high-speed transmission lines. They could also be programmed remotely from the other nodes. Thanks to ARPANET, scientists and researchers could share computer facilities by long-distances. This all happened around the early 1970’s. It was out of this that the Internet came to be as it is today.</P>

</B></FONT><P>The structure of the Internet ensures that it is controlled by the Internet Engineering Task Force. These working groups discuss specific issues. It is decentralised in nature and control. All of its standards are open and publicly available. Because of the size of the Internet, changes occur slowly. The Internet has not finished changing and is unlikely to do so either. The standard for communication is known as TCP/IP. This stands for &quot;Transmission Control Protocol&quot;. The TCP part converts messages into streams of packets at the source, then it reassembles them back into messages at the destination. The IP part handles the addressing, seeing to it that packets are routed across multiple nodes and even across multiple networks. As early as 1977, other networks to link to ARPANET were using TCP/IP.</P>

<P>The Internet’s pace of growth in the early 1990s is spectacular, almost ferocious. It is spreading faster than cellular phones and faster than fax machines. The number of host machines with direct connection to TCP/IP has been doubling every year since 1988. One of the main reasons that people enjoy going on the Internet is because it gives them freedom. It is also a bargain. It doesn’t charge for long-distance service. It also doesn’t charge for access time either. The Internet is a rare example of a true modern anarchy. It has no &quot;Internet Inc&quot;. It does not have bosses , no board of directors or no stockholders. All of this makes it highly attractive to anyone who wishes to use it. Each person that uses the Internet is responsible for their own machine and their own section of line. It is said that it belongs to everyone and to no one. If you think about it, it does make sense. It is because there are no bosses and such over it. I feel that it is a good system to have the Internet available to people and that it contains the freedom to use it. Overall I think that the Internet has a good structure in place. </P></BODY>
