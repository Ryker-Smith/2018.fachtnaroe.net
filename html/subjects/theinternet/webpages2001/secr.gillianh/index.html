<P>History of the Internet</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</FONT><P>The U.S. Department of Defence laid the foundation of the Internet roughly 30 years ago with a network called ARPANET.  The general public did not use the Internet much until after the development of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s.  as recently as June 1993, there were only 130 Web sites.  Now there are millions.  During the 1970s, developers created the protocols used to transfer information over the Internet.  By the early 1980s, Usenet newsgroups and electronic mail had been born.  Most users were affiliated with universities, although libraries began to connect their categories on the Internet.  To give users a friendly, easy-to-use interface to work with, the University of Minnesota created its Gopher, a simple menu system for accessing files, in 1991</P>
<P>The World Wide Web came into being in 1991, thanks to developer Tim Berners-Lee.  Early on, the Internet was limited to non-commercial users because its backbone was provided largely by the National Science Foundation.  Department of Energy, and funding came from the government.  But, as independent network began to spring up, users could access commercial Web sites without using government-funded network.  By the end of 1992, the first commercial online service provider, Delphi, offered full Internet access to its subscribers, and several other providers followed.<BR>
No one authority controls the World Wide Web.  Today's Web site authoring tools allow virtually anyone who has access to a computer and the Internet to post a Web site and contribute to the definition of what this medium is and what it can do.</P>

<P>Structure of the Internet</P>

</FONT><P>The Internet is a global structure.  It is a  network of computer networks connected together which pass data among and within each other special protocols.  Within each network, different computers are designated to handle certain types of data.  All computers on the Internet have a unique host name.  Technically a 'host name' is just a name given to a computer, like 'leonis'.  But in order for this computer to be recognised by other Internet computers, it needs to be given an 'Internet Protocol (IP) Address'.  A  computer network is a series of computers, which are joined.  One of the problems with computers that are joined is that they must all have names  - if they don’t have names, how can they talk to each other?  To make life even more awkward, computers use numbers for names, but humans aren’t that good with numbers. So names are used by humans, while numbers are used by computers.</P>
<P>For example, the name ‘www.yahoo.com’ is actually ’64.58.76.179’.  all that really needs to be known is the name.  The computers will do the translation into numbers.  The allocation of names and the conversion of names into numbers are controlled by the ICANN, The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.  This is an organisation that anyone can join to express his or her opinion on the running of the Internet.  While the ICANN looks after the naming principles, the IANA looks after the allocation of numbers to the available names.  </P>
<P>In all countries the assignment of the manes for that country is governed by the same rules given out by the IANA.  If Ireland the assignment of numbers is controlled by the Irish Domain Registry.</P></BODY>
