</B></FONT><P>The Internet came about when the U.S. Department of Defense laid the foundation of  it roughly 30 years ago.  In 1957, the U.S. government formed the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a segment of the Department of Defense charged  with ensuring U.S. leadership in science and technology with military applications.  In 1969, ARPA established ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet.  ARPANET was a network that connected major computers at the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa Barbara, Stanford Research Institute, and the University of Utah.  Within a couple of years, several other educational and research institutions joined the network.</P>

<P>In response to the threat of nuclear attack, ARPANET was designed to allow continued communication if one or more sites was destroyed.  Throughout the 1970s, developers created the protocols used to transfer information over the Internet.  By the early 80s, Usenet newsgroups and electronic mail had been born.  Most users were affiliated with universities, although libraries began to connect their catalogues to the Internet, too.  During the late 1980s, developers created indices, such as Archie and the Wide Area Information Server (WAIS), to keep track of the information on the Internet.  To give users a friendly, easy-to-use interface to work with, the University of Minnesota created its Gopher, a simple menu system for accessing files in 1991.</P>

<P>The World Wide Web came into being in 1991, thanks to developer Tim Berners-Lee and others at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics.  By the end of 1992, the first commercial online service provider, Delphi, offered full Internet access to its subscribers, and several other providers followed.  As of April 1998, there were more than 2.2 million sites on the Web.</P>

</B></FONT><P>The Internet is a worldwide structure.  It is a network of computer networks.  A computer network is a series of computers which are joined.  One of the problems encountered with computers that are joined is that they must all have names – just like humans have to have names to communicate with each other effectively so must computers.  Computers cannot comprehend names, they can only comprehend numbers which makes life very hard for us mere mortals as it is much easier for us to remember names than numbers (well for most people anyway!).  For example the name <B>‘www.yahoo.com’ </B>is actually <B>’64.58.76.179’</B>.  This may seem confusing but all we actually need to know is the name of the website and the computer will do the translation for you.</P>

<P>The allocation of names, and the conversion of names to numbers is controlled by the <B>ICANN</B>, the Internet corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.  This is an organisation that anyone can join to express their opinion of the operating of the Internet. The <B>IANA </B>looks after the allocation of numbers to the available names.  The <B>IANA </B>makes sure that no two people can have the same name for their computer networks.  After all, there should only be on <B>Levi’s</B>.  In all countries the assignment of the names for that country is governed by the same rules given out by the <B>IANA</B>.  In Ireland the assignment of numbers is controlled by the <B>Irish Domain Registry</B>.</P>
