<P>RACHEL KENNEDY</P>

</B></FONT><P>The Internet was started about 30 years ago.  The U.S. Department of Defence started the foundation of the net.  The public did not use the Internet until after the development of the World Wide Web in the 1990’s.  In June 1993 there were only 130 Web sited and by the end of April 1998 there were more that <B>2.2 million</B> sited on the Web.   In 1988 there were 56,000 hosts and by 2000 there were 72,398,092.</P>

<P>In 1969 advanced research projects agency established the forerunner to the Internet.  The computers were connected to a large net work at a university in Los Angeles. </P>

<P>During the 1970’s protocols were used to transfer information over the Internet.  By the time the 80’s came around electronic mail was around.  This was used in colleges and libraries.</P>

<P>Information had to be kept track of and developers created indices such as Archie and Wide Area Information Server to keep track of the information used on the Internet.  People needed help to use the Internet as it was new technology and a Gopher was created.  It was simple menu used for accessing files.</P>

<P>Thanks to the developer Tim Berners-Lee and his team, they created a protocol to connect on the Web with hyperlinks.</P>

</B></FONT>
<P>To be able to communicate with one computer you would have to know what name it is called.  All computers that connect to each other communicate through numbers.  When you are logging onto the Internet you are typing characters but the computer is reading numbers.  Names are converted into numbers and The Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers controls this.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority looks after the allocation of numbers to names available.  Two of more companies can’t have the same Internet addresses so the names are looked after by the IANA. </P>

<P>The numbers allocated to Internet addresses have to be controlled as not to use the same number twice.  The IANA are global and rules do apply and have to be followed.   In Ireland the Irish Domain Registry controls the assignment of numbers.  </P></BODY>
