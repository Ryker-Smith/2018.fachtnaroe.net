<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1973 the U.S Defence Advanced Research Agency (DARPA) initiated a research program to investigate techniques and technologies for interlinking packet networks of various kinds. The objective was to develop communication protocols, which would allow networked computers to communicate transparently across multiple, linked packet networks.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system of protocols, which was developed over the course of this research effort, became known as the TCP/IP Protocol Suite, after the two initial protocols developed: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). Both public domain and commercial implications of the roughly 100 protocols of TCP/IP protocol suite became available in the 1980’s.During the early 1990’s. OSI protocol implementations also became available and, by the end of 1991, the Internet grew to include some 5,000 networks in over three dozen countries, serving over 700,000 host computers used by over 4,000,000 people.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RAND Paul Baran, of the RAND Corporation was commissioned by the U.S Air Force to do a study on how it could maintain its command and control over its missiles and bombers, after a nuclear attack.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARPA awarded the ARPANET contract to BBN. BBN had selected a Honeywell minicomputer as the base on which they would build a switch. The physical network was constructed in 1969, linking four nodes, the network was wired together via 50 KBPS circuits.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1972</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first email program was created by Ray Tomlinson of BBN. AIRANET was currently using the Network Control Protocol or NCP to transfer data. This allowed communications between hosts running on the same network. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1973</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development began on the protocol later to be called TCP/IP, it was developed by DARPA. The new protocol was to allow diverse computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1976</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr. Robert M. Metcalfe develops ETHETNET, which allowed coaxial cable to move data extremely fast. This was a crucial component to the development of LANs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The creation of BITNET, by IBM introduced the &quot;store and forward&quot; network. It was used for email.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1983</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On January 1<SUP>st </SUP>every machine connected to ARPANET had to use TCP/IP. TCP/IP  became the core Internet protocol and replaced NCP entirely.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tim Berners –lee and CERN in Geneva implements a hypertext system to provide efficient information to access to the members of the international high-energy physics community</P>
