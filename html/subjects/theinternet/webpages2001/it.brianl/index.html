</B></U></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is basically a network of networks connected world-wide. Anyone with access to some sort of a computer with a modem and phone line can use the Internet for what ever means necessary. Currently there are millions of people all over the world that use the Internet in their everyday lives. The Internet has become a way of life and it has spawned the creation of much needed employment in our very own country.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with many great inventions, this particular invention was created out of need for improvement to this particular area. In the 1960's a group called ARPNET, who were a group of computer scientists working for the American military were in great competition with the USSR. After the launch of the Russian satellite, the Americans launched the first working Internet, which was appropriately called ARPNET. The Americans were trying to protect data even through a nuclear disaster.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the 1970's some American colleges hit on to the idea of the Internet and soon they set up there own separate local Intranet's. After much debate a lot of the Universities were connected to ARPNET even though lots of American government officials didn't agree with it. In the 1980's the first electronic mail first came into use, this impressive way of communication has since become the worlds number one mailing service.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARPANET allowed scientists and researchers to share facilities over long distances. However it was not entirely being used for the purpose its makers intended. Most of the messages being sent on the ARPANET were personal ones. The military thought that this was not good for security and so formed their own network, called MILNET in the early 1980's. By 1990, ARPANET, the original network, became a less and less significant part of what once it was the superpower.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1990 a man that was working for a group called CERN developed the first HTML protocol. Tim Berners Lee's idea allowed people all over the world to communicate no matter what kind of a computer they had and no matter what type of Operating System was being used. This idea quickly spread world-wide and has become a tremendous success.  </P>
