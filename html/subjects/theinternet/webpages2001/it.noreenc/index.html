<P>The Internet is a network of computers connected together via a modem and a phone line. Anyone with access to a personal computer and the proper software can get on the Internet.</P>

<P>It wasn’t always that easy to get access. The Internet started off in the 1960’s as a project by the American military to protect their information from being wiped out if it was stored in one place on one supercomputer. They came up with a system of dividing the information into packets sent to different computers called nodes. This was the first functioning Internet and was called ARPNET after the Advanced Research Projects Agency that developed it.</P>

<P>In the late 1960’s and the early 1970’s the universities took up the idea for a communication system for use within the university. When some scientists were denied access to the ARPNET because it was set up for military use they decided to set up their own network and called it Usenet News. This system was used by scientists and academics to exchange data and information and was eventually connected to ARPNET.</P>

<P>In the early 1980’s the National Science Foundation in America built its own network. Soon the network began to be used for sending electronic mail.</P>

<P>Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web, which is the basis of the Internet, as we know it. He did this in 1990 while he was working at CERN research center in Switzerland. It was based on the idea that computers no matter what type they were or what operating system they were using, they should be able to communicate with one another He developed the HTML protocol from an earlier version that was not as easy to move from system to system. This would mean that no matter what type of computer you were using, with the help of a browser you could read files written in HTML. In 1992 CERN institute released the rights to the World Wide Web into the public domain.</P>

<P>The Internet Corporation for assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was set up to assume responsibility for IP address space allocation, protocol parameter agreement, domain name system management and root server system management functions. This is a non profit corporation made up of nineteen directors, three each from the Address Supporting Organisation, Domain Name Supporting Organisation and Protocol Supporting Organisation and the other nine by a vote from Internet users worldwide.</P>

<P>From then on the general public accepted the web as a means of communication. As more people now have access to computers in schools, Colleges, Libraries and places of work it is becoming acceptable to search for information on the Internet as a first choice when information is needed  </P>
