<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B></U></FONT><P>The Internet is changing our lives in many ways. It is like a revolution, which is changing everything it remotely, touches.  The aspects of our lives, which have been touched, are many, starting from personal uses like shopping to medical advice and going beyond business use.  At present most of us are restricted for connection to the Internet through the phone line connection.  However, the technological advances made recently will no longer restrict net users to phone lines and PC: Web-enabled mobiles are the new development.  ‘OPEN’ – the Digital Television Company is hoping to bring the Internet to the masses via their television sets.</P>

<I><P>What is the Internet?</P>
</I><P>The Internet is a global computer network made up of hundreds of smaller networks linked together by the international telephone system.  These networks are run by governments, academic institutions and corporations.  Individual companies link to this matrix of networks by connecting to the nearest node, again via a phone line.</P>

<I><P>Where did it all start?</P>
</I><P>These recent developments in the Internet make one look back on the history and the structure of the Internet.  In the 1960’s at the request of the US Government, researchers began experimenting with linking computers with each other and to people through telephone hook-ups, using funds from the US Defence Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).</P>
<I><P>E-mail</P>
</I><P>ARPA was successful in linking computers in different locations by using a new technology known as packet switching, which let several users share a single communication line.  The packet system allowed for the creation of a data highway, on which large number of vehicles could essentially share the same lane.  This system allowed computers to share data and the researchers to exchange electronic male, or e-mail.  In itself, e-mail was something of a revolution, offering the ability to send detailed letters at the speed of a phone call.  The network created was fault-tolerant, decentralised, and capable of surviving a nuclear attack. It also provided a way for researchers to share computing resources, thus reducing resource costs.</P>
<I><P>Video Conferencing</P>
</I><P>As this system grew (known as ARPA Net), some enterprising college students developed a way to use it to conduct on-line conferences.  These conferences soon branched out to virtually every field, as people realised the power of being able to &quot;talk&quot; to hundreds of people around the world. </P>
<I><P>World-wide net </P>
</I><P>In the 1970’s ARPA helped support the developments of rules, or protocols, for transferring data between different types of computer networks.  These &quot;Internet&quot; protocols made it possible to develop the world-wide Net we have today.</P>

<P>By the close of the 1970’s, links had developed between ARPANet and counterparts in other countries.  The world was now tied together in a computer web.  In the 1990’s, the Net grew at an exceptional rate.  In the present century also, the number of people linked to the Net is ever increasing. </P>

<I><P>Structure of the Internet</P>
</I><P>The worldwide Net is actually a complex web of smaller regional networks. To understand it, picture a modern road network of transcontinental motorways or superhighways connecting large cities.  From these large cities smaller carriageways link together small towns, whose residents travel on slower, narrow residential roads.  So, there is no one central computer or group of computers running the Internet – its resources are to be found among thousands of individual computers. This is its greatest strength.  This approach means it is virtually impossible for the entire net to crash at once – even if one computer shuts down, the rest of the network stays up.  </P></BODY>
