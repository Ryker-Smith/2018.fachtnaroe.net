<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE INTERNET</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roughly 30 years ago, the US Department of Defense laid the foundation of the Internet. Until the early 1930s, the general public didn’t use the Internet much. In June 1993 there were only 130 Web Sites. Now there are millions. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1957, the US government formed the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a segment of the Department of Defense charged with ensuring U.S. leadership in science and technology with military applications. In 1969 ARPA established ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARPANET was a network that connected major computers at the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa Barbara, Stanford Research Institute, and the University of Utah. Several other educational and research institutions joined the network, within a couple of years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the threat of nuclear attack, ARPANET was designed to allow continued communication if one or more sites were destroyed. Unlike today, when millions of people have access to the Internet from their homes, work, or their public library, ARPANET served only computer professionals, engineers, and scientists who knew their way around its complex workings.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evolution</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the 1970s, developers created the protocols used to transfer information over the Internet. Usenet newsgroups and electronic mail had been born by the early 1980s. Most users were affiliated with universities, although libraries began to connect their catalogues to the Internet, too. During the late 1980s developers created indices, to keep track of the information on the Internet. In 1991, the University of Minnesota created its Gopher, a simple menu system for accessing files, created to give users a friendly, easy-to-use interface to work with.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Structure of the Internet?</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is hundreds of thousands of "networks" connected to each other in one gigantic global network. It’s as though everyone in the whole world whose computer is connected to the Internet is part of one, big hometown. Anyone can connect to this huge network through his or her computer-power with telephone and cable communication lines. One of the problems with computers that are joined is that they must all have names – if they don’t have names, how can they talk to each other. Computers use numbers for names and because we are not that good with remembering numbers, we use names for humans. If we want to search for something on the Internet, all we have to do is type in the subject name and the computer automatically translates it into numbers so that it can understand what it is we are searching for. The ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is the controller of the allocation of names, and the conversion of names into numbers. Anyone can join this organisation to express his or her views and opinions on the running of the Internet. Somebody has to be in charge of the allocation of names, we cannot have the same name as some other company, otherwise things would get all mixed up. While the ICANN looks after the allocation of names, the IANA looks after the allocation of numbers to the available names. IANA (the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority make sure that no two people can have the same name for their computer networks. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In all countries the assignment of the names for that country is governed by the same rules given out by the IANA. In Ireland, the Irish Domain Registry controls the assignment of numbers.</P></BODY>
