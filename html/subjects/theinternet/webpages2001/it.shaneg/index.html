<P>The Internet is a network of computers, which are connected together using a modem and a phone line.  It all began about 30 years ago, when the U.S department of Defence founded the net, which at the time was known as the ARPANET.  It did not become popular with the public until the 1990’s.  In 1993 only 130 web sites were estimated to exist.  However by 1998 there was more than 2.2million Websites on the Internet.</P>

<P>Using the Internet wasn’t always easy, but developments throughout the 70’s and 80’s have made the Internet what it is today.  The American Military began using the Internet to store and send information from one place to another.  This means of sending and storing information then became popular with universities and libraries.  </P>

<P>For some time scientists were denied access to the ARPNET, because it was set up for military use only.  The 1980's founded the National Science Foundation in America.  They built their own network and soon began sending information using electronic mail.</P>

<P>The World Wide Web as we know it, was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. He had the idea that no matter what computer was being used, it should be able to communicate with another one.  He developed the HTML protocol from an earlier version that was not easy to move from one system to another system.  Now with the help of a browser a computer would be able to read files written in HTML.  By 1992 the CERN institute released the rights to the World Wide Web.</P>

<P>All computers that connect to each other communicate through numbers.  When a person logs onto the Internet the characters they type in are read like numbers by the computer.  The Internet Corporation controls the method in which names are converted into numbers for Assigned Names and Numbers. This company also allocates the amount of numbers available to names.  Two or more companies cannot have the same Internet address.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) controls all this process.</P>

<P>The Internet has been around for quite some time now and has developed into an everyday means of communicating with each other.  It has vast amounts of information on it and remains the one of the biggest developments of the past century in the world of computers.  It has dominated the last decade and will surly remain a dominant force in the world of computers in the next few decades. </P>
