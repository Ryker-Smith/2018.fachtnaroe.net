<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The History of the Internet</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet was founded about 30 years ago by the United States Department of Defense with a network called ARPANET.  ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) was formed in 1957 by the American Government to ensure United States leadership in science and technology with military applications.  In 1969 ARPA established ARPANET.  In 1972 the first e-mail program was created.  The term Internet was first used in 1974.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following year development began on the protocol later to be called TCP/IP.  This new protocol allowed computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other.  The Department of Defense began to experiment with this and soon decided to require it for use on ARPANET.  The University of Wisconsin created Domain Name System (DNS) in 1983, this made it much easier for people to access other servers, because they no longer had to remember numbers.  ARPANET was originally used to connect major computers at the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa Barbara, Stanford Research Institute and the University of Utah. </P>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike today, when millions of people have access to the Internet from home, work and libraries, ARPANET only served computer professionals, engineers and scientists who understood its complex workings.  The World Wide Web came into being in 1991.  Early on, the Internet was limited to non-commercial uses because its backbone was provided largely by the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the United States Department of Energy, and funding came from the government.  By the end of 1992, the first commercial online service provider offered full Internet access to its subscribers, and several others followed.  Many people think that the Internet and the World Wide Web are the same thing, but the World Wide Web is just one part of the Internet that combines words and pictures to make some fascinating sites.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet has grown at a phenomenal rate.  In <B>1988</B> there were <B>56,000</B> hosts, by January <B>2000 </B>there were <B>72,398,092.</B>  In June <B>1993 </B>there were <B>130</B> sites on the World Wide Web, by October <B>2000</B> there were <B>22,282,727</B> sites available.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Structure of the Internet</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is made up of hundreds of thousands of &quot;networks&quot; connected to each other in one huge network.  Because the Internet combines computer power with telephone and cable communication lines, it is an all-new type of communication.  In order for computers to communicate with each other they must have names.  Computers use numbers for names but as it would be quite difficult for humans to remember numbers, we use names and computers do the translation into numbers.  The allocation of names and the conversion of names into numbers is controlled by the ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).  This organisation is open to the public and gives everyone the opportunity to express their opinion on the running of the Internet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to make sure that no two people have the same name on their computer networks, the allocation of numbers to the available names is governed by an organisation called The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems likely that the Internet will continue to be the link of diverse systems in the academic, government, and business sectors for the remainder of this decade and well into the next.</P>
