</FONT><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the Internet?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is a network of computers from all over the world, which are all connected to each other through telephone lines via a modem.  A modem can either be external or as is usually the case nowadays already built into the computer.  The job of a modem is to convert digital signals from your computer to analogue signals that can be transmitted through the telephone line, when the signal gets to the receiving computer the information is then converted back from analogue to digital signal through the receiving modem.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is a way of transferring information from one place to another electronically.  Just as we can talk to each other on the telephone, with the Internet we can send and receive a whole manner of information over the Internet i.e. programs, documents, email, upload\download files, browse for information on almost any subject you like, chat online, find out all the latest news worldwide, play games the list goes on.  The language used for the Internet is called Transmission Control Protocol\Internet Protocol (TCP\IP).  TCP\IP allows any kind of computer communicate with other kinds of computers.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is one of the most powerful forms of media today.  It is accessible to anyone.  It is not owned or run by any single organization.  There is no censorship for the Internet.  You can set up a web site on any subject that you like and any person with Internet access can visit that site.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How did it all begin?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the late 50's and early 60's the American Department of Defence (DOD) wanted to find a way of keeping communications open in the event of a nuclear attack.  A system was required that if one computer or a link between computers was damaged all the other computers connected to the network would still be able to communicate with each other.  In 1969 the Advanced Research Projects Agency (APRA) was created.  In the beginning APRANET consisted of a network of four computers, now there are thousands of computers connected and this is increasing daily.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The solutions that APRANET arrived at were - many routes of communication were needed, communication should be between two computers, any of the computers on the network would know where to send and transmit data and all the computers would use the same set of rules when communicating with each other.  Down through the years there have been various other networks such as USENET, MILNET, NSFNET and many others.</P>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who owns the Internet?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any one individual or company does not own the Internet.  As stated above, originally the Internet was designed for the DOD in America.  In the early 1970s the Internet was opened up to the public.  To start with it was mainly education institutes that used the Internet now anyone with a computer, a modem and a telephone line can have access to the Internet.  Governments and commercial industry mainly fund the Internet.  The Internet is a free service all you have to pay for is the cost of your calls while you are online.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do you go Online?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First you will need a computer, a modem and access to a telephone line.  Next you will need to register with an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  An ISP is a company that gives you access to the Internet.  There is a large amount of ISPs to choose from but basically they all offer the same service.  Some to the options ISPs may offer include free email addresses and free web space for you to build you own web site.  They will probably have different options on price as well.  Most give the option of a free service where you just pay for the price of a local phone call or you can pay a monthly subscription and surf the net for as long as you like.  This second option usually applies to off-peak times.  The reason that these companies are able to offer free Internet access is because they receive an amount of the call charges from the phone company.  So you really are paying them for the service in a roundabout way.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is WWW?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WWW stands for World Wide Web or the Web.  The web is a way of connecting resources on the Internet by using links.  There are thousands of pages of information on the Internet and the Web is simply a user-friendly way of accessing these pages.  You just have to click on the hyperlinks – highlighted text - to take you to another Internet site.  You can also access pages on the Internet by typing in a web address in the location bar of your browser.  The correct term for a web address is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).  There are different parts to a URL.  For example the following URL <A HREF="http://www.tesco.co.uk/">http://www.tesco.co.uk</A> when broken down means:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">http:// - HyperText Transfer Protocol.  This is the language that the browser uses to read a                                                                                                               web page</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">www. – World Wide Web states that the computer is on the web.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">tesco.co.uk – the name of the server that stores the file.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A browser is a program that gives you access to the web.  Some examples of browsers would be Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer.</P>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What can be done on the Internet?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet can be used for a wide variety of services.  <B>Electronic Mail</B> (Email) gives you the ability to send messages to anyone with an email address.  These messages could include attachments containing pictures, text, sounds or animation.  Email messages can be sent to numerous people all at the same time.  It is a very efficient way of sending documents quickly. If I wanted to forward an important business document to a company in America and they needed it immediately I could simply email it to them and they would have it almost instantly.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Electronic Commerce</B> (Ecommerce) is where business transactions are carried out over the Internet.  When shopping on the Internet almost anything can be bought or sold.  Cars, houses, books, computers and computer software.  Practically anything that can be bought from a shop can be purchased over the Internet.  Along with buying products on the Internet you can also search for services such as booking a hotel room or find a carpenter.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Downloading/Uploading files.  </B>There are any amount of files that can be downloaded via the Internet.  Games, screensavers, software updates, tools to maintain you computer, drivers or anti-virus software.  Downloading means copying files from one computer to another.  Uploading is simply the opposite of downloading.  Any type of file can be downloaded or uploaded to the Internet. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chat Rooms</B> are web sites where users can have conversations with each other by typing in text messages from the keyboard.  Anyone can join a chat room.  Whatever you type in will appear on the screens of all the users that are in the chat room.  Members could be anywhere in the world but they cam all communicate with each other as if they are all in the same room.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resources that are available through the Internet are many and are varied.  There are many good things to come from the Internet as well as many bad things.  But this can be said about almost anything in life.  The Internet is only as good as the people that use it.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the bad things to come from the Internet include:</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Viruses, </B>which are malicious programs designed to create damage to other computers.  Viruses range from being annoying to being very destructive.  Some viruses do silly things like display a picture or play sounds on your system.  Other viruses can cause a lot of damage like completely deleting the contents of the hard disk.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hackers</B> are like house burglars.  They are people who break into other computers.  Some hackers just do it for the fun and to say that they could actually get into a certain computer.  Others may be more dangerous and actually steal important information so it can be used in a destructive way.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pornography </B>is readily available over the Internet.  This is not a bad thing in itself but this can be abused.  It is ok when consenting adults use this type of entertainment but when children can gain access to it that is a different matter.  As well as this the amount of children being used in pornography and then being displayed over the Internet is a very serious matter.</P>
