<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet came to be about 30 years ago in the U. S. with a network called ARPANET.  But the general public didn’t use the Internet much until after the development of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s.  Up to June 1993, there were only 130 Web sites.  Now there are millions.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was formed by the U.S. government in 1957, a segment of the Department of Defence charged with ensuring U.S. leadership in science &amp; technology with military applications ARPA, established ARPANET the forerunner of the Internet in 1969.  ARPANET Research and Education was a net work that connected major computers at some of the Universities of the U.S. A. such as California, at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa Barbara Stanford Research Institute and the University of Utah.  Within a couple of year, several other educational and research institutions joined the network.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the threat of nuclear attack, ARPANET was designed to allow continued communication if one or more sites were destroyed.  In the early days gone by nobody from homes, schools, workplaces etc had access to the Internet because they did not know how to use it only engineers, professionals and scientists.</P>

</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is a network of computer networks connected together which pass information and messages within each other using special protocols.  Within each network, different computers are designed to handle certain types of information, and we indentify these computers according to these functions: and we identify these computers according to these functions: all computers on the network have a different host name.  Technically, a &quot;host name’ is just a name given to a computer, like ‘leonis.  But in order for this computer to be recognised by other Internet computers, it needs to be given and Internet Protocol (IP) Address, or a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or simply ‘ Domain Name’ or ‘Host Address for short.</P>

</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An IP Address is made up of a series of numbers separated by periods (e.g. 137. 132. 1.18) a computer has to be assigned by any Internet computer.  Your PC/Mac needs to be assigned an IP Address to access any Internet server.  IP also mapped to FQDN, ‘leonis.nus.sg’.  FQDN is made up of higher level domain names and the host name.  ‘SG’ shows the computer belongs to a system in Singapore, and the domain ‘hus’ shows the computer belongs to NVS.  You have got to know this host address if you want to access Internet computers.</P>
