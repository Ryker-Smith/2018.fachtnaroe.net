<P>Node = A terminal in a computer network. </P>

</FONT></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first nodes of the Internet were set up in UCLA in 1969. By December of that year,
there were four nodes on a network, which was called ARPANET, after its Pentagon sponsor.
The four computers could transfer data on dedicated high-speed transmission lines. They
could even be programmed remotely from other nodes. Thanks to ARPANET, scientists and
researchers could share one another's computer facilities by long-distance. By 1972,
ARPANET contained thirty-seven nodes. And it was good.

</FONT></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As early as 1977, other networks used TCP/IP to link to ARPANET.
 ARPANET itself remained fairly tightly controlled, at least until 1983, when its military
 segment broke off and became MILNET. But TCP/IP linked them all. And ARPANET itself,
 though it was growing, became a smaller and smaller neighbourhood amid the vastly growing
 galaxy of other linked machines.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the '70s and '80s advanced, many very different social groups found
themselves in possession of powerful computers. It was fairly easy to link these computers
to the growing network-of- networks. As the use of TCP/IP became more common, entire other
networks fell into the digital embrace of the Internet. Since the software called TCP/IP
was public domain it was difficult to stop people from barging in and linking up
somewhere-or-other. In point of fact, nobody wanted to stop them from joining this branching
complex of networks, which came to be known as the "Internet."

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">Domains</P>
</FONT></B>

<P>The nodes in this growing network-of-networks were divvied up into basic varieties.
Foreign computers, and a few American ones, chose to be denoted by their geographical
locations. The six basic Internet "domains" grouped the others: gov, mil, edu, com, org and net.
Gov, Mil, and Edu denoted governmental, military and educational institutions, which were, of
course, the pioneers, since ARPANET had begun as a high-tech research exercise in national
security. Com, however, stood for "commercial" institutions, which were soon bursting into the
network like rodeo bulls, surrounded by a dust-cloud of eager non-profit "orgs."
(The "net" computers served as gateways between networks.)
</P>

<P>The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is spectacular, almost ferocious.
It is spreading faster than cellular phones, faster than fax machines. Last year the
Internet was growing at a rate of twenty percent a month. The number of "host" machines
with direct connection to TCP/IP has been doubling every year since 1988. The Internet
is moving out of its original base in military and research institutions, into elementary
and high schools, as well as into public libraries and the commercial sector.
