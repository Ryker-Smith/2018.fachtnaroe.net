<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</U></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like so many other inventions, the Internet grew from the needs of the military. In the early 1960’s the USA and the former Soviet Union were involved in what was known as the Cold War. Both countries spent a great deal of time and money trying to out-do one another in terms of the weapons they produced and in trying to ensure that an attack could be successfully defended in the event of a nuclear war. This was one of the problems looked at by the US Defence Department.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it was impossible to design a communications network that had components that were so well protected that they could withstand the power of a nuclear explosion. It was also impossible to defend a command centre, which would be one of the first areas targeted by enemy missiles.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Rand Corporation, a research organisation also known as the 'think tank' came up with the answer. There would be no central command. Consequently, if part of it was destroyed in the event of an attack, information could automatically be re-routed to its destination via the undamaged part.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first test network based on these ideas was set up by the National Physical Laboratory in Britain in 1968. Shortly afterwards, the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), part of the US Defence Department, began work on a more complex network. By December 1969, four computers were linked by high-speed lines to form the ARPANET.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARPANET allowed scientists and researchers to share facilities over long distances. However it was not entirely being used for the purpose its makers intended. Most of the messages being sent on the ARPANET were personal ones. The military thought that this was not good for security and so formed their own network, called MILNET in the early 1980's. By 1990, ARPANET, the original network, became a less and less significant part of the network of networks that were coming into existence and so would eventually, disappear altogether.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet Arrives</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1986, the US National Science Foundation set up NSFNET, connecting top-of the range supercomputers with high-speed links. The use of the network by universities and corporations was so successful that the idea quickly spread to the private sector and by mid-1980 heralded the birth of the Internet. The Internet became public in 1995 although its standards were always public and its growth is now driven by consumer interest.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks, connected so that information can be accessed and exchanged easily. The World Wide Web (WWW) (developed by Tim Berners Lee) is a vast library of information, which has become known as the 'Information Superhighway'. It provides opportunities for global communication between individuals and groups.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having important files in a central location (such as on a server) allows many different users to have easy access to them. The Internet works in the same way. A web browser such as 'Netscape' is run from your computer to retrieve information from another computer acting as the server. On the Internet you have access to millions of servers all over the world.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Broadly speaking, the Internet is just one big WAN (Wide Area Network) made up of lots of LANs (Local Area Networks) i.e. an example of a LAN would be the network of computers in a school or building. For example in a business there may be several LANs (Local Area Network) connecting each department's computers. Each LAN is connected to a high-speed link called a backbone, usually by way of a telephone line. Together the LANs plus the backbone form a Wide Area Network (WAN) and the biggest WAN of all is of course the Internet. Computers called routers are used to link one network to another and keep the data traffic flowing smoothly. They connect LANs to WANs and WANs to bigger WANs. If you have 2 or more networks linked together you have an internet and the biggest internet of all, is of course, the <B>Internet.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The structure of the Internet is controlled by the Internet Engineering Task Force. All standards are open and publicly available. However, changes occur slowly because of its size.</P>
