<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The
internet timeline begins in 1962, before the word internet was even
invented. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S.
Department of Defence lays the groundwork for  ARPANET. The ARPANET
is basically the forerunner of today&acute;s Internet. (ARPA) awarded
to BBN the contract to build a network of four Interface Message
Processors located at different sites.  Information could be passed
on from one computer to </FONT></SPAN>another <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>by
using the ARPANET system.</FONT></SPAN>The network expanded to twenty
three sites by April 1972 and thus gave rise to today&acute;s booming
market of Internet technologies.<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>
However, it was Ray Tomlinson, a computer engineer who was working
for the company that invented ARPANET, who made great strides in
advancing the Internet. Ray Tomlinson sent the first message from one
computer to another across a network in 1971, the computers were
literally side by side. Tomlinson, by combining the SNDMSG program,
which allowed users of the same computer to leave messages for one
another, and the CYPNET program that would allow users to send files
to remote users linked to the ARPANET, had created the technology to
leave messages for users in remote locations on the ARPANET network.
BBN proved that packetizing data was not only but that it</FONT></SPAN>
could be applied to high spead networks transmitting messages across
varied routes to dispersed destinations - the concept underlying
today&acute;s Internet.<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>In
1990 the ARPANET was retired. Due to the explosion of Internet use
the U.S. Gouvernment had to transfer management to independent
organizations in 1995.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">
<FONT SIZE=3>In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee, wanted to easily access his
saved phone numbers and documents he wrote, they were both saved in
different databases. He created a hypertext computer program that
allowed him to make the connections. Later, he developed a program
that could link databases around the world. He named it the “World
Wide Web”.  When he distributed his software in 1991  other
computer whizzes immediately developed the idea.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Rather
than saying who makes the internet work we should concentrate on what
makes the internet work. The unique thing about the Internet is that
it allows many different computers to connect and talk to each other.
This is possible because of a set of standards, known as that govern
the transmission of</SPAN><B> </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">data

<FONT SIZE=3>When something goes wrong with an e-mail or the
internet, a common response is to tell the teacher that “the
internet is broken” and to immediately give up in frustration.
Proper participation on-line requires an understanding of an internet
as a system, and the protocols and processes necessary to communicate
flexibly and fluently through the medium. We must also be able to
articulate and build on this understanding through an accurate and
flexible knowledge of relevant vocabulary. So if we familiarise
ourselfs with the internet we can deal comfortably with the day to
day problems we may encounter.</FONT></P>
