Structure of the Internet</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=4>Is The
Internet a Democracy:</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>Yes the
Internet is a democracy. The people who choose to use the Internet
help in how it works. Anyone can go on the 'net' and exchange idea's
with people about anything without the feeling of government
filtering or commercial partiality. This is why most users of the
Internet are against censorship or control of information on the
Internet. Further sometimes people like to chat without anyone
knowing what they look like or their race or sex.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>It is seen
that democracy is a <SPAN LANG="en-GB">privilege</SPAN> of
cyberspace, the only real form of mass communications. The Internet
is seen as any-to-any where by it doesn't matter the place or the
race. The only problem here is that the any-to-any connectivity can
only occur when the acquired hardware is installed in the persons own
machine that they are working from. People then need to invest in
this hardware to communicate via the Internet this making the network
of networks to work.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>In a time
where people seem to be less concerned about their democratic right
to be involved in society the Internet seems to be one of the
reason's for this even though it is a gateway for people to get
involved if they choose to do so. Something that has eluded the
people in power to date. The Internet compares to a company in the
respect's that both money and know how is needed to make it work, yet
differs from a company in the respects that there is no chairman like
figure to control it.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>Which brings
me to my next point <B>Who Owns The Internet? </B>And the answer to
that is no-one and no single person or <SPAN LANG="en-GB">organisation</SPAN>
control it. The Internet relies on a physical infrastructure that
connects networks to other networks. There are many different
<SPAN LANG="en-GB">organisations</SPAN>, corporations, governments,
schools, private citizens and service providers that all own pieces
of the infrastructure but there is no one body that owns it all.
There are however organisations that oversee and <SPAN LANG="en-GB">standardise</SPAN>
what happens on the Internet ans assign IP address's and domain names
such as the National Science Foundation, the Internet Engineering
Task <SPAN LANG="en-GB">Force</SPAN>, ICANN, InterNIC and the
Internet Architecture Board. These in turn all make the Internet
work. </FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3><B>How Does
The Internet Work? </B>Different parts of the Internet work
differently but they all use the main network and transmit
information the same way. Information travels around the Internet in
packets and if the packet is too big it is broken down and
reassembled at it's destination. As the packets travel to their
destination they bounce from peer to peer like pinballs. They are
directed around the Internet by routers which the determine the best
and fastest route around the Internet for each packet. Physical
distance means nothing in cyberspace.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Where did
The Internet Come From? </B>The Internet was developed in 1970 by
ARPAnet, the Advanced Research Projects of the U.S. Department of
Defense. It was designed to allow the scientific community to
communicate. It was reportedly created specifically to survive a
nuclear attack that would have cut off normal communications, like
telephones, because it is self healing. That means if one part is
shutdown, the routers reroute the traffic around the shutdown. It
fixes itself. In its early years, before the development of the World
Wide Web, academic and scientific institutions <SPAN LANG="en-GB">monopolised</SPAN>
the Internet. It's a good thing too. No one other that someone with
an advanced computer engineering degree could find anything on the
Internet before the Web was developed.</FONT></P>
