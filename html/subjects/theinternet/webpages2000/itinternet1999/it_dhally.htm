<p>In the 1960s, researchers started to experiment on computers. They tried
to link computers to each other and on people. They achieved this by telephone
hook – ups, using money from the United States Department of Defence’s
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
<p>A new technology was created it was called packet switching, and ARPA
wanted to see if computers in different locations could be linked. Packet
Switching means that data meant for another location is broken into small
pieces. They have their own “forwarding address”. ARPA had a goal and it
wasn’t to creation of today’s international computer using community.
<br>The developers could not survive a nuclear attack.
<p>&nbsp;
<br>Old style computer networking efforts needed a line between each computer
on the network. The creation of the data highway was allowed through the
packet system. Large numbers of vehicles could share the same lane. This
system allowed computers to share information and the researchers to exchange
e–mail.
<p>There is a system known as ARPARNET, some college student have constructed
a way to use it to conduct online meetings.
<br>They started off small but they soon spread out virtually in every
other field.
<p>In the 1970s, The development of protocols for transferring data between
computer network, which ARPA helped support? The worldwide web couldn’t
possibly be developed.
<p>In the 1980s, All the networks became to be know as the Internet. Some
of these computer systems began offering access to the public. Now anyone
with a modem or a computer could tap into the world.
<p>In the 1990s, the Internet is still growing at an incredible speed.
The estimated amount of messages been transferred through the Internet
grows about twenty percent a month. Because of this the government and
other users in previous years have tried to expand the Internet. Before
the Internet was able to reach the latter speed, now Internet experts can
process data at 2,000,000,000 bits of information per second. In the middle
of 1994, the United States Government removed itself from control over
the Internet workings.
