<P>The Internet is for me hard to get a grip of because it’s so big. It makes it easier to understand if you think of it as being lots of computers that share information and communicate with each other. Or I suppose it’s more right to say that they connect people using computers to mediate.</P>

<P>The information on the Net can be anything from, graphics, sound clips, jokes, newspapers and there are lots more. You can also send e-mails, join discussion groups, chat with people from all over the world. Even create your own home page. The Internet is run by the people on the Net, basically you and me.</P>
<P>To make the operation on the Internet smother there is a international workgroup called The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Anybody interested is free to take part.</P>
<P>There is also the Internet Activities Board (IAB). They provide research advice to the Internet community. As the Internet grows very rapidly there are also Network Information Centers (NCI’s) to serve the users with advice and assistance.</P>

<P>How did it all start?</P>
</B></FONT>
<B><P>1957</B> As we all know it was developed in USA. It all started when the US Air Force wanted to know if it was possible to keep the control over its missiles after an nuclear attack.</P>

<P>The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was formed  to find out if this was possible. The group came up with a solution, called a packet switched network. This means that data is broken down into data grams or ‘packets’. This ‘packets’ are sent forward through computers until it finally arrives at the receiving computer. If the ‘packets are lost on their way, the message could be sent again from the sender. This is how the idea about a network all started.</P>

<B><P>1969</B> Over ten years later the switch was first built in to one computer as the base.  The first Net work was constructed with four links, all connected to universities in America. The whole net work was wired together via 50 Kbps circuits.</P>

<B><P>1972</B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>The first e-mail is created<FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT>This means that you can send and receive mail from family and friends all over the world.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT><B><P>1973</B> The renamed research group, now called Defense Advanced Researched Project Agency(DARPA) started to investigate if it was possible to make different networks to interlink together. The project was called the internetting project A year later the term Internet was used for the first time. This was the name for the system that the research group had put together.</P>

<B><P>1979</B> There were also other research groups during this period. USNET was created by two students. This is the news group network. At the discussion groups a wide range of topics are discussed and anyone can respond and join in.</P>

<P>The creation of BITNET was introduced. Also called the &quot;store and forward &quot;network. This was used for e-mail and listservers.</P>
<B>
<P>1981</B>CSNET was founded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) they were to provide academic network servicing for for universitity, industry and government research groups. </P>
<B>
<P>1986</B> The National Science Foundation (NSF) started the development of the NSFNET. Today they are a major provider of the communication service for the Internet. </P>
<P>Other big providers in America are Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US Department of Energy in form of the NSINET and ESNET. In Europe we have NORDUNET.</P>

<P>By the end of 1991 Internet included approximately 5000 networks over 36 countries and was used by over 4 mil people.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=5><P>What is the World Wide Web?</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT><P>The World Wide Web is created in 1994. The web makes the Internet reasonable easy to access. The language used to create www pages are called Hyper Text Markup Languages (HTML). The web is presented with a page of text and graphics with links that you select. This links take you to resources on the Internet. The software that is used are called browser software, to name a few Netscape Navigator or Internet explorer.</P>
<P>To search on the web you can also use a web address that you know. Just type in the address of the site you want to visit. The addresses are called URLs and stands for Uniform Resource Locator. The addresses can be very long. This is because you might have to go through many directories to get to the one you want. A web address can look like this.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>http://www.isoc.org/guest/Zakon/Internet history</P>

<P>http</B> stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This is the protocol for connecting to <B>WWW</B> pages on the Net. The next part is the name of computer where the page is located. The part <B>isoc.org/guest</B> tells the browser to look in another directory called <B>Zakon</B> and finally into another directory to find a document called <B>Internet history</B>. This is how I was browsing to get the information on the history of the Internet in this assignment.</P>
