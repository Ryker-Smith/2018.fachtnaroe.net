<P>In the early 1960’s, two of the worlds super powers, the USA and the former Soviet Union were in the middle of what was known as the cold war. Both countries spent a great deal of time and money trying to out-do one another in terms of weapons they produced and in trying to ensure that an attack could be successfully defended. One of the problems the US looked at was how to keep the communications open after a nuclear strike by the Soviet Union. The command centre would be impossible to protect as it would be one of the first things targeted by the enemy, and it would be impossible to design communication equipment strong enough to with stand a nuclear blast. What they needed was something that had no central command and that could carry on operating even if some of its parts were destroyed.</P>

<P>JCR Licklider came up with the idea of global networking. A network where every node is equal to every other node and each node was capable of sending and receiving messages to and from every other node, so there was no single route through the network.</P>

<P>Leonard Kleinrock at MIT came up with the concept of using packets instead of circuits when sending messages. This meant messages would be divided into packets and sent through the network. Each packet would take a different route and meet up again at the intended address. It wouldn’t matter if a part of the network was missing because any node that receives a packet would send it on in the direction of its destination even if that means taking the longest route. So in late 1966 Lawrence Roberts who was also from MIT went to DARPA (Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) to develop the computer network concept and put together his plan for the &quot;ARPANET&quot;, he published it in 1967. At the conference where he presented his paper he discovered that the work at MIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at NPL (1964 -1967) had all proceeded in parallel without any of the other researchers knowing about the other.</P>

<P>Since Kleinrocks early development of pocket switching his Network Measurement Centre at UCLA was selected to be the first node on the ARPANET. The BBN installed the first IMP (Interface Message Processor) at the UCLA and the first host computer was connected. The second node was at the Stanford Research Institute and was connected to the ARPANET a month later and the first host-to-host message was sent from Kleinrocks laboratory to the SRI. By the end of 1969 there were four host computers connected together to form the ARPANET. Two nodes were added one at The UC Santa Barbara and the other at the University of Utah. The UCSB was investigating the possibility of displaying mathematical functions using storage displays to deal with the problem of refresh over the net and Utah were investigating the methods of 3D representation over the net. Now thanks to ARPANET scientists and researchers could share one another’s computer facilities from a long distance. By 1971 there was fifteen nodes in ARPANET and by 1972 there was thirty-seven nodes.</P>
<P> In December 1970 the Network Working Group finished the initial ARPANET host-to-host protocol called the Network Control Protocol. In 1972 Ray Tomlinson at BBN developed the first basic e-mail message send and read software and in July Roberts wrote the first e-mail utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward and respond to messages. E-mail became the largest network application in over a decade. </P>

<P>By now it had become clear that the ARPANET users had different ideas for the Internet, the main traffic on ARPANET was not long distance computing but news and personal messages. ARPANET allowed researchers and scientists to share computer facilities over long distances. However, it was not being used for the purposes its makers intended. Most of the messages being sent were personal ones. People had their own addresses for the E-mail and they were making use of this to exchange ideas with each other and often just to have a chat. This proved to be a far more popular way to communicate long distance. The military felt this wasn’t good for security and formed their own network called MILNET in the early 1980’s.   </P>

<P>In the beginning ARPANET used the NCP (Network Control Protocol) to control the transfer of information between its computers. This was replaced the more sophisticated TCP/IP Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP converts messages into packets to be sent, then puts them back together into messages when they reach their destination. The IP takes care of the addressing of the packets and ensures that each one can be sent across different nodes in the network. TCP/IP was made available to anyone who wanted to use it. By 1977 other fast growing networks were linked to ARPANET using TCP/IP. ARPANET became a less and less important part of the network of networks that was coming into existence. By 1990 it had disappeared altogether.   </P>

<P>By the mid- 1980 over 50,000 computer nodes were linked to the Internet. Computers in countries as far apart as New Zealand India and Brazil joined in. In the early 1990’s commercial companies were allowed on to the Internet for the first time. Ordinary people with access to Universities could set up their own Internet accounts through the growing number of service providers that had been established. Today they are more than a million nodes scattered around the world linking tens of millions of people, each one with a unique E-mail address.  </P>
