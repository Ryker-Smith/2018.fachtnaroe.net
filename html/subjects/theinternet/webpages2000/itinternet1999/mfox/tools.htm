<blockquote>It is important to have the right tools for the right job.&nbsp;
The main tools used in the preparation of a room are scrapers, filling
knives, sandpaper, steam strippers, and blow torches.
<p><b><font size=+1>Scrapers</font></b>
<br>There are several different type of scrapers that may be used for different
stripping jobs.&nbsp; The flat slightly flexible scrapers such as the Broad-blade
and the Narrow-blade are used for scraping flat surfaces such as ceilings,
walls and flush doors.&nbsp; These scrapers come in different sizes such
as 4", 3" or 1".&nbsp; They can be used for removing wallpaper, paint,
ceiling tiles as well as raking out cracks.
<br>Scrapers for removing paint from mouldings such as door or window frames
are called Shave hooks.&nbsp; These are either combination Shave hook which
can be used on rounded mouldings or&nbsp; Triangular Shave hook which removes
paint from corners of window and door frames.
<br>Skarsten scrapers hold a razor sharp blade and will strip paint back
to the bare wood.&nbsp; They are very good for stripping paint or varnish
of hand rails on staircases.
<br>Glass scrapers hold a Stanley blade and are used for removing paint
from glass such as window panes or from ceramic tiles.&nbsp; Always make
sure the blade is not blunt as it is very easy to scratch the surface.
<br>When using any type of scraper never dig into the surface as this will
just cause damage such as dents and scratch marks.&nbsp; The blades should
not be blunt and should just scrap over the surface.&nbsp; When scraping
woodwork always work with the grain of the wood.
<p><b><font size=+1>Steam Strippers</font></b>
<br>Steam strippers are used for removing wallpaper and work by softening
the adhesive underneath the paper thus making it easy to remove the paper.
<p><b><font size=+1>Filler knives</font></b>
<br>Filling knives look much the same as scrapers and come in the same
sizes but they have a much more flexible blade than a scraper.&nbsp; They
should never be used as a scraper as the bade can be easily damaged.&nbsp;
They work by pressing the filler into the hole or crack and then smooth
of the filler.
<p>After all surfaces have been stripped and all cracks raked out everything
will have to be sanded down.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this there are various types
of sanding equipment.
<p><b><font size=+1>Sandpaper</font></b>
<br>Sandpaper can either come in sheets or on a roll.&nbsp; Usually the
roll of paper is better value for money.&nbsp; There are different grades
such as fine grade, medium grade and coarse grade.&nbsp; You can also use
a sanding block which has different grades of coarseness on each side.&nbsp;
Sanding blocks can also be rinsed out with water and used many times.&nbsp;
The reason for sanding down is to remove any flaking paint, bits of old
wallpaper and adhesive, to remove any glaze as well as leaving a smooth
finish to the surface.&nbsp; It also gives the surface a key.&nbsp; As
with using a scraper on wood when sanding down wood always sand with the
grain.
<p><b><font size=+1>Ladders.</font></b>
<br>When decorating any kind of room you will almost certainly need to
use a ladder.&nbsp; Ladders can be very dangerous if not used properly.&nbsp;
You should avoid using a chair or table as a substitute for a ladder, these
were not designed for standing on and reaching a height.&nbsp; It is very
easy to fall from an insecure ladder or a chair on top of a table.&nbsp;
Always choose the appropriate ladder for the job.&nbsp; Make sure the ladder
is secure on the floor.&nbsp; Make sure the ladder is high enough for the
job.&nbsp; Never use a ladder if you have to stand on the top rung or if
you have to reach further than arms length to the side of the ladder.&nbsp;
It is very easy to lose your balance or to unbalance a ladder which results
in falling off.&nbsp; Never rest tools or equipment on a ladder, if they
fall off it can cause serious damage to people below.</blockquote>
