<blockquote><b>Wallpaper</b>
<br>When removing wallpaper you will need a scraper, a 4" paint brush and
a bucket of water.&nbsp; Removing wallpaper can be very easy or can end
up being a very hard and time consuming job.&nbsp; To start off try and
remove the top layer of paper.&nbsp; The best way to do this is to lift
the two bottom corners of the paper with a scraper and try to peel away
the whole layer of paper in one sheet.&nbsp; When top layer of paper has
been removed starting from the top right hand side of the wall wash down
with the brush and water.&nbsp; Completely soak the paper with water and
allow to soak in for a short time.&nbsp; Using a scraper and starting at
the bottom of the wall scrap away as much paper as possible.&nbsp; Any
stubborn areas may need to be soaked more than once.&nbsp; It is often
advised in DIY books and magazines to score the paper but this is wrong.&nbsp;
It serves no purpose to score the walls.&nbsp; Scoring the walls usually
ends up with damaging the&nbsp; plaster&nbsp; by leaving score marks.&nbsp;
So the best method is a paint brush, a bucket of water and a scraper.
<p><b>Emulsion paint</b>
<br>When the existing surface is emulsion paint the problem areas to look
for are flaking paint or blisters in the paint.&nbsp; If there are areas
like this use a scraper to remove all the loose paint
<p><b>Gloss or Eggshell paint</b>
<br>As with emulsion check for unsound paint and remove with a scraper.&nbsp;
Wash down with sugar soap to remove grease.
<p><b>Distemper</b>
<br>Distemper is like a thin layer of chalk which prevents paint adhering
to the wall or ceiling.&nbsp; It can be a nuisance to remove.&nbsp; The
best way is to use a scraper and sandpaper.&nbsp; Completely remove any
loose paint.
