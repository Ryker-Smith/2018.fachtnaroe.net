<P>The Internet was conceived during the Cold War in 1969, when the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, a Department of Defence Organisation) funded research for an experiment to explore the possibility of a communications network.  The objective for the U.S. military was to create a national communications system that would maintain communication integrity in the event of a national emergency and would continue to function if a disaster such as a nuclear war occurred.  In the ARPANET system information moved randomly through many networks and systems rather than travelling over one line.  The information was broken down into smaller pieces called packets, with each packet travelling independently through the network.  Information would never travel the same route twice hence ensuring security.  The new system would be impervious to attacks by other countries, (primarily the former Soviet Union).</P>

<P>For the first decade that the Internet was in existence, it was primarily used to facilitate communications between computers, e-mail which made it's first public appearance in 1972 at the Internet Computer Communications Conference.  In 1975 the Defence Communications Agency gained administrative control of ARPANET.  The mission of the agency was to facilitate the communication needs of the Department of Defence.  Traffic on the network continued to increase rapidly.  However, most users were not military personnel but scientists and researchers who used the network for e-mail, to support online discussion groups, allow access to distant databases and support the transfer of files between government agencies, companies and universities.  Because of this dual application, ARPANET split into two networks: ARPANET - to serve the needs of the academic community and MILNET, which focused on the needs of the military.  Information could be shared between these two networks so this interconnection became known as the DARPA Internet (Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) eventually shortened to the Internet.</P>

<P>In the early 1980's several significant events occurred including the development of the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite of networking protocols, which allows computers on the Internet to communicate using a common language.  It packages and addresses the information and then ensures that the information arrives safely at the intended destination.  By 1983 all research networks were converted to TCP/IP protocol setting a standard for other networks therefore enabling all of the networks of the Internet to send data back and forth and it becomes the only set of protocols on the ARPANET.</P>

<P>In 1990, HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) was introduced, this was a hypertext Internet protocol which could communicate the graphic information on the Internet thus creating a Web site which then became part of a hypertext network called the World Wide Web (WWW).  The Internet was informally renamed the Web and quickly gained great popularity among Internet users.</P>
<P>Today most people use the term "Internet" to refer to the physical structure of the Net including client and server computers and telephone lines whereas the use the term "Web" to refer to the collection of sites and the information that can be accessed when using the Internet. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Internet is a loose association of thousands of networks and millions of computers across the world that all work together to share information.  It is the largest computer system in the world but no one organisation owns or controls the Internet.  There are no government regulations and no one censor's information made available.  It consists of thousands of networks connected together around the world and each government, company and organisation is responsible for maintaining its own network.  Government agencies, companies and universities around the world pay to operate and maintain their part of the Internet.  When you send information, organisations along the way pay for the information that passes through their networks.</P>
