<p><b>The Internet has become a vital part of communication today. More
and more businesses are using it to expand as with over 150,000,000 potential
customers they have the prospect of global business opportunities and profit.
It is becoming a major part of the consumer industry. The Internet is basically
a network of computer networks, a network being ‘An interconnection collection
of computers’. If two computers can exchange information they are interconnected.
A network is a group of computers connected by a communications link that
enables any device to interact with another on the network.</b>

<p><b><u><font color="#CC0000">History</font></u></b></center>

<p><b>The Internet grew from defense and research requirements in the USA
in the 1960’s. It was designed to withstand failure even from nuclear attack.
It has survived and prospered to today as it was found to be a very easy
way to communicate and do business. In 1969, it began as a network of 4
computers called the ‘ARPANET’, and so, the Internet was off the ground.
For the first decade, it was primarily used for electronic mail and to
help transfer files from the government agencies, companies and universities.</b>
<p><b>In 1973, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
started a research program to see if they could interlink networks of various
kinds. The objective was to develop a way in which networked computers
could communicate across linked packet networks. The project and the system
of networks that emerged from this research became known as the ‘Internet’.
By 1983, 200 computers were linked across the USA.</b>
<p><b>During the 1980’s, Internet protocols were introduced. A protocol
is a series of rules for communication between two computers, that everyone
agrees to, and they govern format, timing and error control. The Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol became the only set of
protocols used on the Internet. The government needed to separate military
and non-military sites as the Internet (as it became known) was growing
and so, it was divided in two ‘MILNET’ and ‘ARPANET’. By 1985, the conversion
of the TCP/IP was now completed and the Internet came together.</b>
<p><b>In 1986, the National Science Foundation (NSF) connected six super
computer centers. These provide a communication service and are a major
backbone of the Internet today. NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy
contributed additional facilities in connecting to the Internet, and in
Europe ‘NORDUNET’ and other international companies provide connection
to thousands of computers on a large number of networks.</b>
<p><b>The 1990’s introduced the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) protocol.
Now individuals could create pages on the Internet or ‘web sites’ using
this computer language. The Internet thus became public and is now known
as the ‘World Wide Web’, or ‘www’ for short, which grew from an idea by
Englishman Tim Berners Lee. A protocol called Open System Interconnection
(OSI) was available by 1991 and the Internet had grown to 4,000,000 users.
In 1995, the Internet became public and there were 5,000,000 users. Today,
the Internet has 43,000,000 users but this is growing, as the Internet
is becoming more popular.</b>

<p><b><u><font color="#CC0000">The Structure of the Internet</font></u></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Garamond">The Internet is controlled by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) and no single body owns it. The IETF are
working groups in different parts of the world who discuss specific issues
in relation to the Internet. This makes it decentralised in nature as anyone
can write pages on it or provide information on it with little control.
All standards for the Internet are open and publicly available as propriety
solutions are a threat to these standards. Because it is a global organisation
change in protocols occur more slowly, but they do occur as the Internet
is always changing.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">The Internet works with a combination and technologies
and protocols. These allow the computers on the Internet to communicate
e.g. TCP/IP protocols. There are different ways to carry the information
from computer to computer:</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">Telephone wire</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">Cable TV wire</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">Ethernet wire</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">High speed fiber optics</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">Cellular transmissions</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">Satellite transmissions</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">But connection requires hardware as in a computer,
modem and a phone line. Software as in TCP/IP, a browser e.g. Netscape
and electronic mail are also needed. And an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
is also needed. An ISP sells Internet access and helps customers get connected.
Examples of ISP’s in Ireland are Eircom.net, indigo.ie and iol.ie. A modem
is a box that connects the user’s computer to the Internet.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">Electronic mail (E-mail) is one of the main
applications on the Internet. E-mail has the same rules as letter writing.
The growth of the Internet is partly due to the ability to send ‘letters’
from computer to computer. ISP’s usually provide a standard e-mail address
and mail can be checked on any computer. It is paid for with advertising.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">There has been growing concern on the Internet
about security. But there are a lot of means to secure and keep confidentiality.
Passwords, firewalls and filters are all examples of securing a network.
Viruses are also a concern but these can be prevented using anti-viral
software. Other security measures such as revealing personal details with
care and only purchasing with credit card can be used also.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Garamond">Addresses for the Internet are called URL’s.
URL’s are shown across a bar on the top of the computer screen. A URL specifies
the protocol, server location and file name e.g. <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/index.html">http://www.yahoo.com/index.html</a>.
A server is used as back up to secure and gain access to files on a network.</font></b>
