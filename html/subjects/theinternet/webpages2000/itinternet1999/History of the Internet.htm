<FONT SIZE=2><P>History of the Internet</P>
<P>The internet's history can be traced back to ARPANET - which was started by the US Dept. of Defence for research into networking sometime in 1969. </P>
<P>Many people wanted to put their ideas into the standards for communication between the computers that made up this network, so a system was devised for putting forward ideas. Basically you wrote your ideas in a paper caled a 'Request for Comments' (RFC for short), and let everyone else read it. People commented on and improved your ideas in new RFCs. The first RFC (RFC0001) was written on April 7th, 1969 - that this is probably the closest thing to a 'start date' for the internet. There are now well over 2000 RFCs, describing every aspect of how the internet functions. </P>
<P>ARPAnet was opened to non-military users later in the 1970s, and early takers were the big universities - although at this stage</P>
<P>it resembled nothing like the internet we know today. International connections (i.e. outside America) started in 1972, but the</P>
<P>internet was still just a way for computers to talk to each other and for research into networking, there was no</P>
<P>World-Wide-Web and no email as we now know it. </P>
<P>It wasn't until the early to mid 1980s that the services we use most now started appearing on the internet. The concept of</P>
<P>'domain names', things like 'www.microsoft.com' (Microsoft's web server), wasn't even introduced until 1984 - before that all</P>
<P>the computers were just addressed by their IP addresses (numbers). Most protocols for email and other services appeared</P>
<P>after this. </P>
<P>The part of the internet most people are probably most familiar with is the World-Wide-Web. This is a collection of</P>
<P>hyperlinked pages of information distributed over the internet via a network protocol called HTTP</P>
<P>(hyper-text-transfer-protocol). This was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He was a physicist working at CERN, the</P>
<P>European Particle Physics Laboratory, and wanted a way for physicists to share information about their research - the</P>
<P>World-Wide-Web was his solution. So the web was started, although at this time it was text-only. Graphics came later with a</P>
<P>browser called NCSA Mosaic. Both Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape were originally based on NCSA Mosaic. </P>
<P>The graphical interface opened up the internet to novice users and in 1993 it's use exploded as people were allowed to 'dial-in'</P>
<P>to the internet using their computer at home and a modem to ring up an 'Internet Service Provider' (ISP) to get their connection</P>
<P>to this (now huge) network. Before this the only computers connected were at Universities and other large organisations that</P>
<P>could afford to hire cables between each other to transfer the data over - but now anyone could use the internet and it evolved</P>
<P>into the 'Information Superhighway' that we know and (possibly) love today. </P>

<P>A history of hacking </P>
<P>Hacking has been around for more than a century. In the</P>
<P>1870s, several teenagers were flung off the country's brand</P>
<P>new phone system by enraged authorities. Here's a peek at</P>
<P>how busy hackers have been in the past 35 years. </P>
<P>Early 1960s </P>
<P>University facilities with huge mainframe computers, like</P>
<P>MIT's artificial intelligence lab, become staging grounds</P>
<P>for hackers. At first, "hacker" was a positive term for a person</P>
<P>with a mastery of computers who could push programs</P>
<P>beyond what they were designed to do. </P>
<P>Early 1970s </P>
<P>John Draper makes a long-distance call for</P>
<P>free by blowing a precise tone into a</P>
<P>telephone that tells the phone system to open</P>
<P>a line. Draper discovered the whistle as a</P>
<P>give-away in a box of children's cereal.</P>
<P>Draper, who later earns the handle "Captain</P>
<P>Crunch," is arrested repeatedly for phone tampering</P>
<P>throughout the 1970s. </P>
<P>Yippie social movement starts YIPL/TAP (Youth International</P>
<P>Party Line/Technical Assistance Program) magazine to help</P>
<P>phone hackers (called "phreaks") make free long-distance</P>
<P>calls. </P>
<P>Two members of California's Homebrew Computer Club</P>
<P>begin making "blue boxes," devices used to hack into the</P>
<P>phone system. The members, who adopt handles "Berkeley</P>
<P>Blue" (Steve Jobs) and "Oak Toebark" (Steve Wozniak), later</P>
<P>go on to found Apple Computer. </P>
<P>Early 1980s </P>
<P>Author William Gibson coins the term "cyberspace" in a</P>
<P>science fiction novel called Neuromancer. </P>
<P>In one of the first arrests of hackers, the FBI busts the</P>
<P>Milwaukee-based 414s (named after the local area code) after</P>
<P>members are accused of 60 computer break-ins ranging</P>
<P>from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to Los Alamos</P>
<P>National Laboratory. </P>
<P>Comprehensive Crime Control Act gives Secret</P>
<P>Service jurisdiction over credit card and</P>
<P>computer fraud. </P>
<P>Two hacker groups form, the Legion of Doom</P>
<P>in the United States and the Chaos Computer</P>
<P>Club in Germany. </P>
<P>2600: The Hacker Quarterly is founded to share tips on</P>
<P>phone and computer hacking. </P>
<P>Late 1980s </P>
<P>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act gives more clout to</P>
<P>federal authorities. </P>
<P>Computer Emergency Response Team is formed by U.S.</P>
<P>defense agencies. Based at Carnegie Mellon University in</P>
<P>Pittsburgh, its mission is to investigate the growing volume of</P>
<P>attacks on computer networks. </P>
<P>At 25, veteran hacker Kevin Mitnick secretly monitors the</P>
<P>e-mail of MCI and Digital Equipment security officials. He is</P>
<P>convicted of damaging computers and stealing software and is</P>
<P>sentenced to one year in prison. </P>
<P>First National Bank of Chicago is the victim of a $70-million</P>
<P>computer heist. </P>
<P>An Indiana hacker known as "Fry Guy" -- so named for</P>
<P>hacking McDonald's -- is raided by law enforcement. A similar</P>
<P>sweep occurs in Atlanta for Legion of Doom hackers known</P>
<P>by the handles "Prophet," "Leftist" and "Urvile." </P>
<P>Early 1990s </P>
<P>After AT&amp;T long-distance service crashes on Martin Luther</P>
<P>King Jr. Day, law enforcement starts a national crackdown</P>
<P>on hackers. The feds nab St. Louis' "Knight Lightning" and in</P>
<P>New York grab Masters of Deception trio "Phiber Optik," "</P>
<P>Acid Phreak" and "Scorpion." Fellow hacker "Eric Bloodaxe"</P>
<P>is picked up in Austin, Texas. </P>
<P>Operation Sundevil, a special team of Secret Service agents</P>
<P>and members of Arizona's organized crime unit, conducts</P>
<P>raids in 12 major cities, including Miami. </P>
<P>A 17-month search ends in the capture of hacker Kevin Lee</P>
<P>Poulsen ("Dark Dante"), who is indicted for stealing military</P>
<P>documents. </P>
<P>Hackers break into Griffith Air Force Base, then penetrate</P>
<P>computers at NASA and the Korean Atomic Research</P>
<P>Institute. Scotland Yard nabs "Data Stream," a 16-year-old</P>
<P>British teenager who curls up in the fetal position when seized. </P>
<P>A Texas A&amp;M professor receives death threats after a</P>
<P>hacker logs on to his computer from off-campus and sends</P>
<P>20,000 racist e-mail messages using his Internet address. </P>
<P>In a highly publicized case, Kevin</P>
<P>Mitnick is arrested (again), this</P>
<P>time in Raleigh, N.C., after he is</P>
<P>tracked down via computer by</P>
<P>Tsutomu Shimomura at the San</P>
<P>Diego Supercomputer Center. </P>
<P>Late 1990s </P>
<P>Hackers break into and deface</P>
<P>federal Web sites, including the</P>
<P>U.S. Department of Justice, U.S.</P>
<P>Air Force, CIA, NASA and</P>
<P>others. </P>
<P>Report by the General Accounting Office finds Defense</P>
<P>Department computers sustained 250,000 attacks by hackers</P>
<P>in 1995 alone. </P>
<P>A Canadian hacker group called the Brotherhood, angry at</P>
<P>hackers being falsely accused of electronically stalking a</P>
<P>Canadian family, break into the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</P>
<P>Web site and leave message: "The media are liars."</P>
<P>Family's own 15-year-old son eventually is identified as</P>
<P>stalking culprit. </P>
<P>Hackers pierce security in Microsoft's NT operating</P>
<P>system to illustrate its weaknesses. </P>
<P>Popular Internet search engine Yahoo! is hit by hackers</P>
<P>claiming a "logic bomb" will go off in the PCs of Yahoo!'s</P>
<P>users on Christmas Day 1997 unless Kevin Mitnick is released</P>
<P>from prison. "There is no virus," Yahoo! spokeswoman Diane</P>
<P>Hunt said. </P>
<P>1998 </P>
<P>Anti-hacker ad runs during Super Bowl XXXII. The Network</P>
<P>Associates ad, costing $1.3-million for 30 seconds, shows two</P>
<P>Russian missile silo crewmen worrying that a computer</P>
<P>order to launch missiles may have come from a hacker. They</P>
<P>decide to blow up the world anyway. </P>
<P>In January, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics is inundated</P>
<P>for days with hundreds of thousands of fake information</P>
<P>requests, a hacker attack called "spamming." </P>
<P>Hackers break into United Nation's Children Fund Web</P>
<P>site, threatening a "holocaust" if Kevin Mitnick is not freed. </P>
<P>Hackers claim to have broken into a Pentagon network and</P>
<P>stolen software for a military satellite system. They threaten</P>
<P>to sell the software to terrorists. </P>
<P>The U.S. Justice Department unveils National Infrastructure</P>
<P>Protection Center, which is given a mission to protect the</P>
<P>nation's telecommunications, technology and transportation</P>
<P>systems from hackers. </P>
<P>Hacker group L0pht, in testimony before Congress, warns it</P>
<P>could shut down nationwide access to the Internet in less</P>
<P>than 30 minutes. The group urges stronger security measures. </P>
