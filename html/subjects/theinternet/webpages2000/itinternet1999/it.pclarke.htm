<B><U><P>History</P>
</B></U>
<P>The history of the Internet really began when the RAND Corporation in America performed top secret studies on Thermo-nuclear war scenarios. The American military wanted a system of communications that could survive a direct nuclear strike.</P>

<P>RAND’s Paul Baran proposed that this could be done by routing traffic (information) around the missing links via other countries or satellite’s. Baran’s idea was made public in <B>1964</B>, what he proposed was a packet switched network (electronic messages broken into units of equal size routed along a functioning path to their destination, where they would be reassembled into coherent whole).</P>

<P>In the <B>1960</B>’s and <B>1970</B>’s at the height of the cold war, the United states department of Defence’s research projects agency (DARPA) funded a small group of computer programmers and electronics engineers who wanted to redesign the way computers were operated, with keyboards, screens and graphics. People could interact with computers instead of labouring with arcane punched cards and printouts.</P>

<P>When the DARPA funded programmers and engineers succeeded in creating the computers they wanted, they discovered that they also wanted to use their computers as communications devices. Thus the Arpanet was set up, the original Arpanet had four machines on it, linked together with a packet switched network. </P>

<P>In <B>1966</B> IPTO the Information Processing Techniques office which was a division of DARPA linked 17 of its centres together. By <B>1972</B> after great interest was shown for the network by other government agencies 24 centres were linked together.</P>

<P>By <B>1976</B> satellites started to be used to communicate information, SATNET (Atlantic packet satellite network) connected the United States to Europe using the Intelsat commercial satellite system.</P>

<P>It soon became apparent that a new protocol for the network was needed. The original addressing scheme did not contain enough information to allow for the connection of other large networks. Also a system had to be found to allow the network to recover to recover if it could not talk to the host computer, that it was trying to communicate with.</P>
<P>.</P>
<P>To try and solve these problems <B>IPTO </B>hired Vinton Cerf. Cerf and his students had written the first protocol used on the Arpanet. Cerf was placed in charge of the whole Internet project which included packet, radio packet, satellite and network security.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In <B>1974</B> Cerf and Robert Kahn published ‘A protocol for packet communications’. Their</P>
<P>powerful and flexible protocol which provides for variation in individual network packet</P>
<P>sizes, was nothing less than a line by line definition of today’s Internet. These protocols were</P>
<P>called <B>TCP/IP </B>Transmission control protocol / Internet protocol.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In 1976 the department of defence decided to use this protocol on the Arpanet. January 1983</P>
<P>was the date fixed when every machine connected to Arpanet had to use this new protocol.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>This is when the Arpanet ceased to be and the Internet came into being. Arpanet was not officially taken out of service until <B>1990</B>.</P>

<P>In 1981 two other networks that would play an important role in the history of the Internet were founded. The first was <B>BITNET. </B>It was started by IBM, the basic principle of <B>BITNET </B>was that it was a store and forward network. The second network was CSNET this was set up by the National science foundation. It was designed to work over modems. In 1987 both of these networks combined to form CREN, Corporation for research and education networking.</P>

<P>In 1983 the University of Wisconsin in the US made an incredible breakthrough in the way the Internet worked. They developed the idea of ‘The domain name server, DNS this meant that messages no longer needed to know the exact path, the IP number, to their destination. The domain name server in essence allowed a message to ask for directions along the way.</P>

<P>In <B>1984 </B>NSF realised that the infrastructure of the network needed upgrading, they also realised they did not want the network administration business.</P>

<P>MERIT, MCI, IBM and the state of Michigan won a proposal to manage and upgrade the new network, this new agreement was for a 5 year period, by <B>1988</B> this new network was up and running. MERIT and its partners formed a non-profit corporation called ANS Advanced Network Systems, this was to conduct research into high speed networking.</P>

<P> NSF quickly adopted the new network and by the end of <B>1991</B> all of its sites were connected by this new backbone. During the time it took to make the transition, three years the network grew incredibly. There were now 4.500 different networks connected to the NSF backbone</P>

<P>Between <B>1991</B> and <B>1994 </B>the Internet grew, many new networks were added to the Net.</P>
<P>No major changes were made to the physical network. CREN developed the technology for the World Wide Web (WWW) which soon became the most used application on the Internet.</P>

<P>In <B>1995</B> the National Science Foundation (NSF) announced that as of the 30<SUP>th</SUP> of April it would no longer allow direct access to the NSF backbone and they contracted with the four companies who in turn sold on connections to groups and organisations and also to companies.</P>

<B><U><P>Structure</P>
</B></U>
<P>The topology of the Internet, i.e., the structure of the interconnection among the various pieces of the Internet, is loosely hierarchical. Roughly speaking, from bottom-to-top, the hierarchy consists of end systems connected to local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) through access networks. </P>

<P>An access network may be a so-called local area network within a company or university, a dial telephone line with a modem, or a high-speed cable-based or phone based access network. Local ISP's are in turn connected to regional ISPs, which are in turn connected to national and international ISPs.</P>

<P>The national and international ISPs are connected together at the highest tier in the hierarchy. New tiers and branches (i.e., new networks, and new networks of networks) can be added just as a new piece of Lego can be attached to an existing Lego construction.</P>

<P>The Internet is growing in size every day and estimates of 180 million users of the Internet by 2001 are predicted</P>
