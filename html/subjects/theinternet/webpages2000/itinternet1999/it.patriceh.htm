</FONT><P>The Internet is a unique creation of human intelligence. It represents the growth of a new society within the old. It has revolutionised the computer and communications world like nothing before. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of continuous commitment and investment in researching and developing information infrastructure. It is the transport vehicle for the information stored in files or documents on another computer. The Internet itself does not contain information – it simply is a network of networks, linking computers to each other and sharing information. It is the greatest free marketplace of ideas that has ever existed. </P>
<B><U><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>History:</P>
</B></U></FONT><P>In 1950 there was less than twelve electronic computers. The first ‘electronic brains’ were so big and generated so much heat that they filled air-conditioned warehouses. People were convinced that computers were useful tools, and the slightly less enormous, less expensive devices proliferated, but strictly as high-tech instrumentation for scientists or payroll devices for businesses. However, in 1957, the Soviet launching of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, shifted some funding paradigms in Washington DC. Two direct side effects of that shift were the personal computer revolution and the computer-mediated communications. </P>
<P>Like a lot of infrastructure technology, the Internet began in the 1960’s as a comparatively primitive network of computers whose users were performing various types of military and government scientific research. Some of that research had to do with the network itself. The Internet technology was developed principally by American computer scientist Vinton Cerf in 1973 as part of a United States Department of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project managed by American engineer Robert Kahn. Experts knew that in the event of an enemy attack, part of the governments’ network could be wiped out with a well-targeted nuclear device. A nuclear attack would reduce a network to tatters.The solution was the RAND proposal (the brainchild of RAND staffer Paul Baran). It was made public in 1964, and so began the birth of the Internet.</P>
<P>The idea was not only to distribute libraries of information in multiple computers located in a variety of different locations, but also to establish linking facilities that would allow a message to go from one computer to another through any of the surviving links on the network. Therefore, rather than one outage crippling the entire network, a damaged computer would just become a dead spur, while all traffic would be routed automatically along the remaining paths. During the 1960’s this idea was worked on by RAND, and later on, the US government decided to invest more funding in to the development of what were to be high-speed computers at the time. This was called the Internetting project and the system of networks, which emerged from the research, was known as the Internet. The system of protocols, which was developed over the course of this research effort, became known as the TCP/IP Protocol Suite, after the two initial protocols developed Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). </P>
<P>By 1969 there were four nodes on the infant network, which was named ARPANET. With time and development it was obvious that the network was not being used just for long distant computing but instead for news and personal messages. The network software intended originally for exchanging research and work related files was soon forwarding files of data from these libraries to any individual on the network. It wasn’t long before the mailing list appeared, an ARPANET broadcasting technique in which an identical message could be sent automatically to large numbers of network subscribers. NCP (Network Control Protocol) was the first standard communication but with the passing of time this technique was surpassed by a more sophisticated standard known as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). This converts messages and then reassembles them back at the destination. </P>
<P>In 1984 the development of the technology and the running of the network were turned over to the private sector and to government research and scientific agencies for further development. In 1986, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) initiated the development of the NSFNET, which, today, provides a major backbone communication service for the Internet. With its 45 megabit per second facilities, the NSFNET carries on the order of 12 billion packets per month between the networks it links. In Europe, major international backbones such as NORDUNET and others provide connectivity to over one hundred thousand computers on a large number of networks. Commercial network providers in the U.S. and Europe are beginning to offer Internet backbone and access support on a competitive basis to any interested parties. </P>
<P>Changes in the way computers were designed and used led to the expansion of the computer-using population from a priesthood in the 1950’s, to an elite in the 1960’s, to a subculture in the 1970’s, and to a significant part of the population in the 1990’s.</P>
<P>The personal computer revolution, built on the technical foundation created by the DARPA researchers a decade previously, had created a new industry and a new subculture. Many different social groups found themselves in possession of powerful computers. It was fairly easy to link these computers to the growing network of networks. As the use of IP became more common, entire networks fell into the digital embrace of the Internet. Connecting to the Internet cost the taxpayer little or nothing, like the phone network, the computer network became steadily more valuable. It was difficult to stop people from linking up. In fact nobody wanted to stop them from joining this branching complex of networks, which came to be known as the Internet.</P>
<B><U><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Structure:</P>
</B></U></FONT><P>Ordinary consumers with personal computers cannot just call up a place called ‘The Internet Company’, supply a credit card number, and become a subscriber. Access is possible by connecting a personal computer to a larger computer, which acts as the Internet provider and ‘node’ on the network. The connection may be through a dedicated data phone line. You then use the node’s computer and its Internet software to connect with other nodes around the world, linked together with high-bandwidth data lines. Internets are constructed using many kinds of electronic transport media, including optical fiber, telephone lines, satellite systems, and local area networks. They can connect almost any kind of computer or operating system, and they are self-aware of their capabilities. An Internet is usually implemented using international standards collectively called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). The protocols are implemented in software running on the connected computer. Most computers connected to the Internet are called <I>hosts.</I> Computers that route data, or data packets, to other computers are called <I>routers.</I> Networks and computers that are part of the global Internet possess unique registered addresses and obtain access from Internet service providers.</P>
<P>There are four ways to connect to the public Internet: by host, network, terminal, or gateway access. Host access is usually done either with local area networks or with the use of telephone lines and modems combined with Internet software on a personal computer. Host access allows the attached computer to fully interact with any other attached computer—limited only by the bandwidth of the connection and the capability of the computer. <I>Network access</I> is similar to host access, but it is usually done via a leased telephone line that connects to a local or wide area network. All the attached computers can become Internet hosts. <I>Terminal access</I> is usually done via telephone lines and modems combined with terminal-emulation software on a personal computer. It allows interaction with another computer that is an Internet host. <I>Gateway access</I> is similar to terminal access but is provided via on-line or similar proprietary services, or other networks such as Bitnet, Fidonets, or UUCP nets that allow users minimally to exchange e-mail with the Internet. One of the most important things regarding the Internet is the fact that no single body owns it. It is administrated by its’ users and the Internet Task Force. Anyone can write applications for it or provide information with little control.</P>
<P>Since its inception, the Internet has continued to grow rapidly. In early 1995, access was available in 180 countries and there were more than 30 million users. It is expected that 100 million computers will be connected via the public Internet by 2000, and even more via enterprise Internets. The technology and the Internet have supported global collaboration among people and organisations, information sharing, network innovations, and rapid business transactions. The development of the World Wide Web is fuelling the introduction of new business tools and uses that may lead to billions of dollars worth of business transactions on the Internet in the future.</P>
