<p>The Internet is an international web of interconnected government, education,
and business computer networks. A person at a computer terminal or personal
computer with the proper computer software communicates across the Internet
by placing data in an electronic Internet Protocol (IP) packet and "addressing"
it to a particular destination on the Internet. Communications software
on the intervening networks "read" the addresses and forward the packets.
From a thousand or so networks in the mid-1980s the Internet has grown
to tens of thousands and is available to millions of people worldwide.
<p>The Internet owes its design and architecture to its origins in the
U.S. Defense Department's ARPANET project in 1969 (the name derives from
the Advanced Research Project Agency, the research group within the Pentagon
responsible for the project). Its planners sought to design a network that
could withstand partial destruction and still function. They reasoned that
centralized control of data flow through one or a few "hub" computers would
leave the system too open to disruption. Every computer on the network
should be able to communicate, as a peer, with every other computer. Thus,
if part of the network were destroyed, the other parts would automatically
reroute communications through different pathways.
<p>Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, ARPANET was a wide area network that linked computers at research
centers around the United States. It was the first computer network and
the forerunner of today's Internet.
<p>In the 1960s, the Defense Department was interested in creating a nonhierarchical,
geographically dispersed communications system that would allow the military
to communicate even if one or more key links were destroyed during a nuclear
war. At that time, no standard computer operating system existed; thus,
computers generally could not communicate with one another. Academic computer
scientists were hired to develop the network, which was launched in 1969
with four nodes, or sites: the University of California at Los Angeles;
the University of California, Santa Barbara; Stanford Research Institute;
and the University of Utah. By 1971, ARPANET had expanded to 23 sites;
by 1981, to over 200.
<p>Although the original purpose of ARPANET was restricted to Defense Department
projects, it quickly became a way for academics to communicate on a myriad
of non-defense topics. Scientists without Defense Department clearance
were denied access to ARPANET, so in 1979 an academic network, Usenet News,
began; its nodes eventually connected with those of ARPANET.
<p>In the late 1980s the National Science Foundation (NSF) built five supercomputer
centers to give any academic researcher access to high-power computers.
The NSF built its own network, based on IP technology, to connect the five
centers, and individual university networks were linked to the closest
one. Soon the connections were also being used for purposes such as electronic
mail (e-mail), and Internet traffic is now routed through a loose consortium
of network providers.
<p>The Internet is also a repository of information for businesses and
a data-sharing viaduct for thousands of discussion groups with specialised
interests. The U.S. government posts more and more information on the Internet,
such as Commerce Department data and new patent filings, and most universities
are converting large libraries to electronic form. Cornell University,
for example, has an ongoing project to convert 100,000 books, printed over
the past century, on the development of American infrastructure-books on
bridges, roads, and other public works.
<p>Businesses advertise and market on the Internet. Online catalogs and
advertising interspersed with directory-type information provide many opportunities,
and online shopping is becoming more and more popular. Protection of copyrighted
material is a problem, however, because anyone can "download" (electronically
copy) data from the Internet. Some companies encrypt data for sale on the
Internet, providing decoding keys only to buyers of the data, but this
cannot prevent the buyers themselves, of course, from "repackaging" and
reselling the data.
<p>Internet growth has been fueled by individual users with modem-equipped
personal computers. Most of them subscribe to local networks that provide
a connection to the wider Internet. Many individuals, as well as businesses,
create their own "home pages"-points of access that allow anyone on the
Internet to view and download information. Internet growth has also been
fueled by the development of the World Wide Web: a collection of thousands
of independently owned computers, called Web servers, that are linked worldwide.
Using software "browsers" such as Netscape, individuals can enter the Web
through local "providers" or through the large online services and browse
or "surf" the Internet with increasing ease and rapidity through a system
of hypertext links.
<p>Hypertext is a multimedia technique that allows a computer user to jump
quickly from place to place in a document, or from one document to other,
related documents in a collection. It allows the person to view data in
a nonsequential, nonlinear manner. It is particularly useful for reference
works, such as encyclopedias, which, unlike novels, are not read from beginning
to end.
<p>The connection between one document and another is called a link. Hypertext
links also can be used to connect to maps, photographs, and other features
of the computer software.
<p>Businesses are creating "intranets" on their own private networks. Using
Internet technology, they can link traditional directory, e-mail, and other
networked software applications. The Internet can connect warehouses, manufacturing
sites, retail stores,
<p>and customers easily by using simple browsers freely provided on practically
every computer now sold. The ease of use and the popularity of the Internet
has in turn precipitated a boom in telecommunications services, somewhat
like the way in which the development of the automobile led to the rapid
growth of many other related industries. In fact the Internet today constitutes
only a small percentage of total telecommunications traffic.
<p>Researchers having to conduct complex projects still require much greater
capacity than the Internet has yet provided, however, so in 1995 the NSF
began to meet their needs by converting the Internet "backbone"-the electronic
pipeline between the five supercomputer communications hubs-into a system
with much higher capacity but available only to medical researchers, astrophysicists,
and other such specialists. The managers and users of this new network,
called the Very-High-Performance Backbone Network Service, are increasing
its fiber-optic linkages and adding advanced switches and routers to the
system.
