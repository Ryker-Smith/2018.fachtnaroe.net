They achieved this by telephone hook – ups, using money from the United States Department of Defence’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).</P>
<P>A new technology was created it was called packet switching, and ARPA wanted to see if computers in different locations could be linked. Packet Switching means that data meant for another location is broken into small pieces. They have their own "forwarding address". ARPA had a goal and it wasn’t to creation of today’s international computer using community.</P>
<P>The developers could not survive a nuclear attack.</P>
<P>Old style computer networking efforts needed a line between each computer on the network. The creation of the data highway was allowed through the packet system. Large numbers of vehicles could share the same lane. This system allowed computers to share information and the researchers to exchange e–mail.</P>
<P>There is a system known as ARPARNET, some college student have constructed a way to use it to conduct online meetings.</P>
<P>They started off small but they soon spread out virtually in every other field.</P>
<P>In the 1970s, The development of protocols for transferring data between computer network, which ARPA helped support? The worldwide web couldn’t possibly be developed.</P>
<P>In the 1980s, All the networks became to be know as the Internet. Some of these computer systems began offering access to the public. Now anyone with a modem or a computer could tap into the world.</P>
<P>In the 1990s, the Internet is still growing at an incredible speed. The estimated amount of messages been transferred through the Internet grows about twenty percent a month. Because of this the government and other users in previous years have tried to expand the Internet. Before the Internet was able to reach the latter speed, now Internet experts can process data at 2,000,000,000 bits of information per second. In the middle of 1994, the United States Government removed itself from control over the Internet workings.</P></FONT></BODY>
