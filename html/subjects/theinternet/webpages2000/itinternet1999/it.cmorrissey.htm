<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people today the internet is something that has only been set up in the latter part of the nineties, but the internet actually dates back to as early as 1962. The origin of the internet grew from the American government’s fear of being left totally helpless in the event of a nuclear war. All the opposing side would have to do is to destroy the network central where all their computers were controlled from and the Americans would be left totally vulnerable to further attack. They would have no means of communication and wouldn’t be able to control their weapons. A network that could withstand a atomic bomb was needed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This problem was the concern of the RAND corporation. This is a body set up following World War II. They carry out high-quality, objective research on national security and domestic policies for the American government. In 1964, following research with deep military secrecy, RAND arrived at a solution. The network would have no central authority – all the nodes in the network would have equal status and importance. Each node would have its own authority to originate, pass, and receive messages. The messages being sent were to be divided up into little packets, and these packets sent individually. The packets of the message would then be sent from node to node until it reached its destination node. Each packet of the message would have their own path to follow.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the 1960’s this idea of a decentralised computer network was toyed with. RAND with a few American colleges studied the concept. In 1968, in Britain they set up a test network, soon afterwards the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency decided to set up a larger network of their own. Supercomputers were to be used as the nodes for the network. In Autumn 1969, UCLA had the first node installed and by December there was four nodes connected. The network was called ARPNET after the agency. The computers transferred data on dedicated high-speed transmission lines. Soon the advantages of the network became apparent. Scientists and researchers could share information over long distance. By 1971, there were thirty-seven nodes on the ARPNET.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the second year of operation the network wasn’t just being used for sharing research and information, the network was being used for personal messages. The users were using the network to chat and gossip even a science fiction club was set up. A mailing list was soon drawn up. So that identical messages could be sent to several users. This was given the name of electronic mail. Of course the ‘abuse’ of the network was frowned on but this didn’t prevent it from happening.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the 1970’s the network kept expanding. It didn’t matter who the user was or the brand they were using as long as the computer could speak the new language of the network, they could join.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the network expanded the standard of communication also developed and became more advanced. The original standard was called NCP – ‘Network Control Protocol’. A new standard was developed called ‘TCP/IP’. ‘TCP’ – Transmission Control Protocol this converted the messages into packets at the source and then converted the packets back into messages at the destination. ‘IP’ – Internet Protocol handles the addressing and makes sure the message reaches the correct address by routing across multiple nodes and networks that would have other communication standards.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As early as 1977 other networks were using TCP/IP to join up to the ARPANET. In 1983, the military segment broke away and that was known as MILNET. But everything was still linked by TCP/IP. ARPNET may still have been growing but it was now becoming lost among a huge array of networks. People were now having more access to computers and it was easy to link a computer up to the growing network-of-networks, which came to be known as the ‘Internet’.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Connecting to the Internet didn’t cost a lot as each node had to handle their own financing. The more people that joined the merrier. Like the telephone network, the computer network became steadily more valuable as it embraced larger and larger territories of people and resources.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In1984, the National Science Foundation became involved in the expansion of the Internet. They set up NSFNET, this set the pace for computer advancement, linking newer, faster computers through thicker and faster links. These links were upgraded and expanded in 1986,1988 and 1990.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that there was such a large number of nodes they could be divided up into basic varieties. Foreign computers tended to be denoted by their geographical location, the rest were divided into six domains: gov – government, mil – military, edu – education, com – commercial and org – nonprofit organisations, and net which serves as gateways between networks.</P>
