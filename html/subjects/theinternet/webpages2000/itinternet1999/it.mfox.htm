</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the Internet and how does it work?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is a network of computers from all over the world connected to each other through the telephone line via a modem.  A modem can either be external or as is usually the case nowadays already built in to the computer.  The job of a modem is to convert digital signals from your computer to analogue signals that can be transmitted through the telephone line, when the signal gets to the receiving computer the information is then converted back from analogue to digital signal through the receiving modem.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is a way of transferring information from one place to another.  Just as we can talk to each other on the telephone, with the Internet we can send and receive a whole manner of information ie. programs, documents, email, upload\download files, browse for information on almost any subject you like, chat online, find out all the latest news worldwide, play games, the list goes on.  The language used for the Internet is called Transmission Control Protocol\Internet Protocol, TCP\IP for short.  TCP\IP allows any kind of computer communicate with other kinds of computers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How did it all begin?</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the late 50's and early 60's the American Department of Defence (DOD) wanted to find a way of keeping communications open in the event of a nuclear attack.  A system was required that if one computer or a link between computers was damaged all the other computers connected to the network would still be able to communicate with each other.  In 1969 the Advanced Research Projects Agency (APRA) was created.  In the beginning APRANET consisted of a network of four computers, today there are millions of computers connected the Internet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The solutions that APRANET arrived at were - many routes of communication were needed, communication should be between two computers, any of the computers on the network would know where to send and transmit data and all the computers would use the same set of rules when communicating with each other.  Down through the years there have been various other networks such as USENET, MILNET, NSFNET and many others.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who owns the Internet?</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet is not owned by any one individual or company.  As stated above, originally the Internet was designed for the DOD in America.  In the early 1970s the Internet was opened up to the public.  To start with it was mainly educational institutes that used the Internet now anyone with a computer, a modem and a telephone line can have access to the Internet.  The Internet is mainly funded by governments and commercial industry.  The Internet is a free service all you have to pay for is the cost of your calls on the telephone.  The Internet is completely free to universities, colleges and libraries.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does WWW stand for?</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A HREF="http://WWW/"><FONT COLOR="#000080">WWW</FONT></A> stands for the World Wide Web or just the Web.  When you log onto the Internet the screen that appears is called a Web page.  This page will have different subjects that you can click on with your mouse.  When you position the mouse cursor over a link the cursor appears as a hand pointing.  After clicking on a subject or the proper name a link, you will be taken to Web sites concerning the subject you chose.  Another way of gaining access to a Web site is to enter an address int the address box which is on the location toolbar at the top of the screen.  The correct name for an address is Universal Resource Locator (URL).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An example of an URL</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;<A HREF="http://www.theinternet.com/"><U><FONT COLOR="#000080">http://www.theinternet.com</U></FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">http://&#9;This is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A HREF="http://www/"><U><FONT COLOR="#000080">www</U></FONT></A>.&#9;This means the World Wide Web</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">theinternet.com This is the domain name which identifies which web server hosts the site.</P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What can you do on the Web?</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is probably a Web site for any subject you choose.  There are millions of Web sites to choose from.  There are also chat rooms where you can talk to other web users from all over the world and if you use a WebCam it is possible to see whom you are chatting to.  You can buy goods over the web like books, clothes, a car or even a house.  It is even possible to do your supermarket shopping.  You can search for a job or accomodation anywhere in the world.  The web is becoming more and more popular and plays an important part in the lives of both business users and personal users.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How to go Online.</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First you will need a computer, a modem and access to a telephone line.  Next you will need to register with an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  An ISP is a company that gives you access to the Internet.  There is a large amount of ISPs to choose from but basically they all offer the same service.  Some of the options ISPs may offer include free email addresses and web space for you to build your own web site.  They will probably have different options on price as well.  Most give the option of a free service where you just pay for the price of a local phone call or you can pay a monthly subscription and surf the net for as long as you like.  This second option usually applies to off-peak times.  The reason that these companies are able to offer free Internet access is because they receive an amount of the call charge from the phone company.  So you really are paying them for the service in a roundabout way.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Getting connected.</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Usually the ISP will supply a CD-ROM which may be picked up from almost any place like supermarkets, computer magazine covers or you may see an advertisement with a free telephone number to call.  Once you have the CD-ROM all you have to do is insert it into the disc drive on your computer and follow the instructions.  It is very simple to do.  To setup your email account requires you to give some personal information like your name, address, date of birth and your telephone number.  When all this has been done correctly you are ready to go online.</P>
