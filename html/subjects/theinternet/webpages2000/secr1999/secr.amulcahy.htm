<P ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORY OF INTERNET</P>
</U></FONT><P>The word Internet refers to a collection of computer networks that connect millions of computers located around the world together.  It is the fastest growing area of communication technology that offers an enormous bank of information on most topics.</P>
<P>Its origins are based in the USA's military.  It began as the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) during the Cold War in 1969.  It was developed by the US Department of Defence's (DOD) research people and a number of military contractors and universities.  Their aim was to achieve a communication network that could survive a nuclear attack.  They found that it provided a very convenient was to support to communicate for the first few years of its existence it was used to facilitate e-mail, support on-line discussion groups and also to support the transfer of files between government agencies, companies and universities.</P>
<P>By 1972 there was around 50 universities and military facilities connected to the ARPANET.  During the early 1980's all the interconnected research networks were converted to the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol).  This enables all the networks of the Internet to send data back and forth and the ARPANET became the backbone (the physical connection between the major sites) of the new Internet, which comprised of all TCP/IP and the Internet was born.</P>
<P>In 1990, HTML, a hypertext Internet protocol that could communicate the graphic information on the Internet was introduced. Each individual could create graphic pages (a Web Site) that became part of a huge, virtual hypertext network called the World Wide Web.  This was informally called the Web and a huge additional audience was created.  In August 1996 there was an estimated 156 countries and regions connected to the Internet.  By July 1997 this figure had risen to an estimated 213 countries and regions.</P>
<P>The term Internet is mostly used to refer to the physical structure of the net - client and server computers and the phone lines that connect everything.  The term Web is used to refer to the collection of sites and the information that can be accessed when one is using the Internet.  Its facilities which include high quality presentation and consist of text, graphics, pictures, animation and sound which has been used to great effect to make life easier for the user.</P>
<P>The Internet has revolutionised the computer and communications world like nothing before, with no regard for geographical location.  It represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure.  From this it is clear that the Internet is one of the most fashionable areas of communication.</P>
