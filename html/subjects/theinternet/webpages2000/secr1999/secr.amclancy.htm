</FONT><P>THE<I> </I>HISTORY</P>
</B></U>
<P>The Internet originated in the United States.  It was originally built for the Department of Defence as a means of indestructible military communications around the world in times of war, including nuclear war.  It became very popular within research communities.  As researchers from the department where it was developed moved into the private sector they wanted the same technology they had been working with all along in their new jobs.  So eventually in 1995 the Internet became public.  The Internet is set up of multiple independent networks which have to follow the Internet Protocol – a set of rules.  As the Internet became more and more popular with the general public, companies realised that it would be in their interest to advertise through this resource.  Unfortunately the Internet has been used for bad as well as good – and like everything else in this world you have to be careful on the Internet, certain parts have been infested by some very disturbed people.</P>

<B><U><P>THE STRUCTURE</P>
</B></U>
<P>Computers identify each other by numbers whereas humans name their computers as it is a lot easier to remember a name rather than a sentence of numbers.   </P>
<P>D.N.S. – Domain Name Service – this was designed to convert names that us humans understand and can remember into numbers that the computer can understand.</P>
<P>Computers that are connected to the Internet have to follow a certain set of rules – this is known as Internet Protocol – it is designed in such a way that it will work with every type of computer.</P>
<P>The Internet holds over eight hundred million pages of information so it would be an impossibility to form an index, so there for search engines had to be used to locate information, this involves basic search techniques – the technology being used is new, but it’s still just one huge library only in electronic form.  Most engines will limit the amount of returns but you will find in saying that the amount of returns is normally quite large so could you imagine how many returns you would get if there were no limits.  You can also use a bookmarker or favorites system to mark pages and sites that you visit regularly for quicker and easier access.  The thing to remember when &quot;surfing the net&quot; is that it is in fact a gigantic library and the key note is that you insert a lot of information into the search bar, this will narrow down your search considerably.</P>
<P>Other aspects of the net are the chat rooms.  You literally can have a conversation with a person on the other side of the world while sitting in your living room.</P>
<P>On the Internet there is what is known as electronic mail – Authorities had to be set up also like – IANA – Internet Assigned Names Authority which later changed to ICANN – Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.  This is so that when you send e-mail it goes to the address and person intended.  Each country has it’s own domain – e.g. (.net, .com, .ie, ) this means that my e-mail address <A HREF="mailto:Annmarieclancy@eircom.net"><FONT SIZE=2>Annmarieclancy@eircom.net</FONT></A> is mine exclusively, nobody else in this country or on the eircom webmail can have this address. </P>
<P>The question is though – Who can register a domain?  Well anybody can register a domain name, you just simply pay a fee.  Although companies/ local Authorities and local bodies may register their own name for business purposes, a private person can not register his/her own name.  Registration is centrally controlled.  </P>
<P>The Internet is far from finished changing.  Changes occur slowly because of its size.</P>
<P>As far as I’m concerned the Internet was the greatest invention of all time.  You literally do have the world at your fingertips!  </P>
