<P>The history of the Internet began back as early as 1957 when the American government feared a nuclear attack, which would have left the government helpless.  In 1957 the USSR had launched Sputnik, the 1<SUP>st</SUP> Artificial earth satellite and the American government fearing a nuclear attack set up a body after World War II (1962) the RAND Corporation.  This body was designed to withstand failures, as without it they would have had no means of communication and no control over their weapons.</P>

<P>This body was set up so the government could maintain its command and control over its missiles and bombers.  In 1964 following deep research the RAND came up with a solution.  This was a packet switched network.  This is the breaking down of data into datagrams or packets that are labelled to indicate the origin and destination of the information and the forwarding of these packets from one computer to another until the information arrives at its final destination computer – if the packets are lost at any given point, the message can be resent by the originator.</P>

<P>In the 1960’s RAND with a few American colleges, studied the idea of having a decentralised computer network.  By 1971, there were 37 nodes on the ARPNET.  By 1972, the network was being used for personal messages.  Mailing lists were also set up so identical messages could be sent to the several users.  This was given the name of electronic mail.  Instead of any form of index or catalogue the Internet offers a number of search tools that enable the user to enter a Keyword, from the database the search engine can retrieve any sites and web pages that are related to the word.  The various search engines vary.  Search engines are best used when searching for a known piece of document, computer program or image rather than looking for general information.  </P>

<P>Computers are identified by numbers.  All computers on the Internet use IP – Internet Protocol.  A protocol is a set of rules.  All Internet computers have IP addresses.  Internet Protocol handles the addressing and makes sure the message reaches the correct address by routing across multiple nodes and networks that would have other communication standards.  These IP addresses are controlled by the IANA, ACANN, and each individual country.</P>

<P>According to results, the Internet is estimated to contain 800 million pages of accessible information.  It would be impossible that practically everything is listed in a bibliography.  Subject directories are organised indexes of subject categories that allow the user to browse through lists of web sites by subject in search of information.  Subject directories are compiled and maintained by humans.  Even though searching with a directory may produce fewer results than an engine, the information tends to be more relevant providing links to sites that are not out of context.</P>
