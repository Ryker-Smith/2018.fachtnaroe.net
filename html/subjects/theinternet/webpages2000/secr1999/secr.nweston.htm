<FONT SIZE=5><P>What is the Internet  </P>
</FONT>
<P>The Internet is a computer which connects to a big network and better still anyone can connect to it.  The internet is known to people world-wide.  It’s like when everyone uses it and also it’s like its one part of a big hometown.  </P>

<FONT SIZE=5><P>How does it Work</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT><P>From your home or school, your computer connects to a local network over the phone with a modem. To surf the net, your computer dials a special phone no through your modem.  Your call is carried over a telephone line to your Internet Service Provider (ISP), where it is forwarded again along.  Special high speed telephone lines called &quot;T1&quot; or &quot;T3&quot; lines to a …….   Network Service Provider (NSP).  These NP’s run high –speed telephone networks all over the world.  </P>
<P>Your computer reaches its final destination on the Internet over these networks.  The Internet is like a TV as the TV offers lots of different channels like news, entertainment, etc.  Likewise with the Internet where it offers thousands of sites.  Also it lets you see lots of pictures and sites its like a library.  There are millio9ns of documents available on the World Wide Web.  It’s like all of this information at your fingertips.  Also it’s like a library on your desktop only lighter.  Better still lots of people can look up the same document posted on the World Wide Web at the same time.  Post information to each other to gossip and communicate etc.  </P>

<FONT SIZE=5><P>Internet E-mail</P>
</FONT><P>Electronic E-mail or &quot;e-mail&quot; is the most common form of communication on the internet.  You start by creating a message in an electronic mail form.  Then, choose the recipient’s e-mail address and send it with a click on a button.  The mail message gets sent to the receiving computer-whether it’s in Tokyo, Japan, downtown Chicago or your neighbour’s house-sometimes within seconds.  </P>
<P>Unique addresses this is how they work.  The first part of the address identifies the individual recipient.  The second part includes the &quot;domain name,&quot; The third part includes &quot;com&quot; tells you the company is a business, or commercial organisation.</P>

<P>also useful to them to enable them to still keep control over nuclear arms for a counter attack.  In 1968 the ARPRANET contract came about.  BBN had selected a Honeywell minicomputer as the base on which they would build the switch.  The physical network was constructed in 1969 linking linodes.  The network was wired together via 50 kbps circuits.  </P>

<P>1972 the first e-mail program was created by Ray Tomlinson of BBN.  ARPANET was currently using the Network control protocol or NCP to transfer data.</P>

<P>1974 First use of the term internet by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in paper or transmission control protocol.  </P>

<P>1992 internet Society is charted.</P>
