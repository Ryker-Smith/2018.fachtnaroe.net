</B></FONT>
<P>It is hard to escape reading about the INTERNET.  You see World Wide Web addresses all the time in newspaper stories and TV ads.  There is still a lot of confusion about what the Internet really is.  Many people use the terms &quot;Internet&quot; and &quot;World Wide Web&quot; to mean the same thing.  Really, the World Wide Web is just one part of the Internet.  But, it gets the most attention because it combines words and pictures to make some really good sites.</P>

<P>The Internet is hundreds of thousands of &quot;networks&quot; connected to each other in one gigantic global network.  It is as though everyone in the whole world whose computer is connected to the Internet is part of one, big hometown.  The best part is that anyone can connect to this huge network through his or her computer, either at home or at school.  The Internet combines computer-power with telephone and cable communications lines, it is an all-new type of communication.</P>

</B></FONT><LI>From your home to your school, your computer connects to a local network over the phone with a modem.</LI>
<LI>To &quot;surf&quot; the Internet, your computer dials a special phone number through your modem, which sends the signal to the telephone line.</LI>
<LI>Your call is carried over the telephone line, to …</LI>
<LI>… Your Internet Service Provider (ISP), where it is forwarded again along…</LI>
<LI>… Special high-speed telephone lines, called &quot;T1&quot; or &quot;T3&quot; lines, to a …</LI>
<LI>… Network Service Provider (NSP).  These NSP’s run high-speed telephone networks all over the world.</LI>
<LI>Your computer reaches it final destination on the Internet over these networks.</LI></OL>


<P>The Internet is like a TV.  Your television offers dozens of &quot;channels&quot; with news, entertainment and educational programmes.  Likewise, the Internet provides thousands of &quot;sites&quot; where you can find news, entertainment and educational programming, ranging from cartoons, sport and nature programmes and much more.  </P>

<P>The Internet is also like a Library.  There are millions of documents available on the World Wide Web.  Having all of this information available at your fingertips is like having a library on your desktop.  What is better is that more than one person can read a document on the World Wide Web at the same time, which saves you waiting days for somebody to return a book, which you want to read.</P>
