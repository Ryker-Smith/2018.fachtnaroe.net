</B></I></U></FONT><P>The development of the Internet began during the Cold war in 1969.  It was researched by the US military and universities to investigate its effectiveness and survival - should a nuclear attack occur.  It proved to be a very convenient way to communicate and continued to be used by Government Departments, Universities and Companies.  </P>
<P>It gradually developed over 2 decades from an e-mail facility to a network that was able to send data back and forth.  In 1990 graphic information and text was developed on the Internet, commonly known as a web site and that was our first introduction to the "World Wide Web" (WWW).  This facility opened a wide range of information and therefore attracted a variety of new Net users, both for personal and business use.  </P>
<P>The attractiveness of the Internet is that anyone can connect to this global network through their computer.  Accessibility is relatively simple depending on the service required.  Services include the following structures:  </P>
<OL>

<LI>The computer connects to a local network over the phone with a modem.  </LI>
<LI>To "surf" the Internet, the computer dials a special phone number through the modem, which sends the signal to the telephone line.  </LI>
<LI>The call is carried over the telephone line, to the Internet Service Provider (ISP).</LI>
<LI>It is forwarded again along special high-speed telephone lines called "T1" or "T3" lines to a Network Service Provider (NSP).  These NSP's run high-speed telephone networks all over the world.  </LI>
<LI>The computer reaches its final destination on the Internet over these networks.   </LI></OL>

<P>The Internet provides thousands of "sites" where you can find news, entertainment and educational programming.  Unlike television you don't have to "tune in" at a certain time to see or hear information - it is available wherever you are.  There are tens of millions of documents available on the World Wide Web.  </P>
<P>To help you find the information you want there are lots of card catalogues and electronic search tools some of these directories, (i.e. "YAHOO") let you look up information according to the title or subject.  E-mail is the most common form of communication on the Internet, and costs less than telephoning long distances, and as a result more businesses, schools and individuals are using e-mail as a simple, affordable way to stay in touch.  </P>
<P>Thousands of different interest groups, known as "Newsgroups" are set up to "talk" about various topics.  Anyone on the Internet can post a comment or question to the Newsgroup.  Other discussion groups, known as "Chat" rooms let you talk "live" with others who are connected to the Internet at the same time.  A program FTP ("File Transfer Protocol") makes it easy to copy information. </P>
