</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet works by using a system of pathways and addresses.  It is not at all like the phone system where a dedicated circuit is created for a phone call.  A system of ethernet cables, modems, communication links and communication computers called routers enable messages to travel from one point to another.  A local area network in a building is usually constructed around an ethernet cable.  A gateway computer is on the network, and it is able to talk to other gateway computers on other networks, usually by phone.  In this way a number of small networks are connected together to form the Internet.  Router computers on the Internet have the job of deciding where to send the packets.  A packet is essentially an envelope of data.  Routers determine the route that a packet will take to complete it’s journey from source to destination by a number of different paths.  When there are multiple paths, data transmission will not be stopped when a single gateway is malfunctioning.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order for all these computers to communicate they must abide a set of communication rules or network protocols.  The protocol of the Internet is TCP/IP or Transmission Control Protocol or Internet Protocol.  Within the protocol rules for addressing packets of data and rules for assembling and disassembling packets.  When newcomers to the Internet start to communicate, one of the first things they have to master is the use of Internet addresses, which consist of domain and server names.  Internet addresses have the form – <A HREF="mailto:name@server.domain"><FONT SIZE=2>name@server.domain</FONT></A>.  The domain name often indicates the type of organisation that owns the server, e.g., .com = Commercial Organisation; .net = Networking Organisation.  The structure of the Internet can be compared to other computer platforms such as Microsoft Windows.  Just as Windows supports many different software applications like word processing and spread sheets, the Internet supports many different applications such as the World Wide Web and e-mail.  The decentralisation of the Internet is one of it’s biggest advantages and one of it’s most basic features.  If one piece is broken, it doesn’t mean the Internet is broken.  It is this decentralisation that has permitted the Internet to grow faster for longer than any other technological phenomenon in history.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet was the result of some visionary people in the early 1960s who saw great potential value in allowing computers to share information on research and development in scientific and military fields.  JCR Licklider of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, first proposed a global network of computers in 1962 and moved over to the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in late 1962 to head the work to develop it.  Leonard Kleinrock of MIT also and later UCLA developed the theory of packet switching, which was to form the basis of Internet connections.  A Massachusetts computer was connected with a California computer in 1965 over dial up telephone lines.  It showed the feasability of wide area networking, but also showed that the telephone lines circuit switching was inadequate.  Kleinrock’s packet switching theory was confirmed.  Lawrence Roberts, who experimented with the California and Massachusetts computers moved over to DARPA in 1966 and developed his plan for ARPANET.  These visionaries and many more are the real founders of the Internet.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet was brought online under a contract led by the now renamed ARPA, which initially connected 4 major universities in the American South-West – L.A., Santa Barbara, Utah and Stanford). 1974 marked the beginning of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) architecture and it would take several years of modification and design before it was completed and universally adopted.  The Unix to Unix Copy Protocol (UUCP) was invented in 1978 at Bell Laboratories.  Usenet was started in 1979 based on UUCP.  Newsgroups, which are discussion groups focussing on a topic, followed, providing a means of exchanging information throughout the world.  Similarly, BITNET (Because it’s time Network) connected IBM mainframes around the educational community and the world to provide mail services beginning in 1981.  Listserv software was developed to connect BITNET with the Internet and allow exchange of e-mail.  E-mail allows one-to-one or one-to-many mailing.  Mail is received and held by a mail server within an organisation or by an Internet Service Provider until the addressee logs on to collect the mail.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the commands for e-mail were standardised, it became easier for non-technical people to learn to use the Net.  It opened up the Net to many more people in universities in particular.  In 1989 a significant event took place making the Net easier to use.  Tim Berners-Lee and others at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, proposed a new protocol for information distribution.  This became the World Wide Web in 1991 – a system of embedding links in text to link to other texts.  Since the Internet was initially funded by the government, it was originally limited to research, education, and government uses.  Commercial use was prohibited unless they directly served the goals of education and research.  This policy continued until the early 1990s when independent commercial networks began to grow.  Delphi was the first American commercial online service to offer Internet access to it’s subscribers.  It opened up e-mail communication in July 1992 and full Internet service in November 1992.  All pretences of limitations on commercial use disappeared in May 1995 when the National Science Foundation ended it’s sponsorship of the Internet backbone, and all traffic relied on commercial networks.  AOL, Prodigy and Compuserve all came online.  Microsoft’s full scale entry into the browser, server and Internet Service Provider market completed the major shift over to a commercially based Internet.  AOL’s acquisition of Time-Warner was the largest merger in history when it took place and shows the enormous growth of Internet business. </P>
