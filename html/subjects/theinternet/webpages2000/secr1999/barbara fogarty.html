<P>THE HISTORY OF THE INTERNET</P>

</B></U></FONT><P>The Internet, also known as the Net, or World Wide Web, is a giant world-wide network of computers that store and share information.  They’re linked by high-speed phone lines that carry electronic data round the globe.  You can log on to the Internet from home, from school or even from a caf&eacute;.  Much of the information is stashed on the millions of pages that make up the World-wide Web.  So whether you’re doing your homework, nosing round for stuff about a pop group or helping your parents to buy a car, you can bet there will be plenty of websites to help you – all the cost of a phone call. </P>

<P> In 1957 the USSR launches Sputnik, the first artificial earth satellite.  In response, the United States forms the Advanced Research Projects Agency within the Department of Defence to establish US lead in science and technology applicable to the military.  In 1962 Paul Baran of the Rand Corporation (a government agency) was commissioned by the U.S Air Force to do a study on how it could maintain its command, and control over its missiles and bombers, after a nuclear attack so that if any locations (cities) in the U.S were attacked, the military could still have control of nuclear arms for a counter attack.</P>

<P>In 1968 BBN had selected a Honeywell mini computer as the base on which they would build the switch.  The physical network was constructed in 1969, linking four nodes, University of California at Los Angeles, SRI (in Stanford), University of California at Santa Barbara, and University of Utah.  In 1972 the first e-mail program was created by Ray Tomlinson of BBN.  There were now 23 hosts.  In 1973/74 there were 23+ hosts.  In 1976 Dr. Robert M. Metcalfe develops Ethernet, which allowed coaxial cable to move data extremely fast.  This was a crucial component to the development of LANs.  There were now 111+ hosts.  In 1979 there were 111+ hosts.</P>

<P>In 1981 there were 213 hosts, and 1983 562 hosts.  In 1984 1024 hosts this has continued to grow at a rapid pace, so by 1996 there were 15,000,000 hosts and still growing.  In 1995 The National Science Foundation contracted with four companies that would be providers of access to the NSF backbone.  The companies had to follow protocol (which is a set of rules to follow).  Because the Internet is so big, changes occur slowly and global organisations move slowly, but the Internet has not finished changing.  To connect to the Internet it requires hardware such as computer, modem, phone line, it also requires software.</P>

<P>To make the Internet it requires TCP/IP it also requires ISP (Internet Service Provider) for e.g Eircom.  Permanent Internet connections are preferable but much more expensive than dial-up ones.  Computers are identified by numbers, they cannot handle names.  There is an IP address with every computer.  Search engines overcome the vastness of the Net, the technology is new, but it is still just a library, learn the rules for one or more search engines, and you can use them all.  An example of a search engine would be Yahoo or Alta Vista.  When you are searching for information on the Internet you will need a DNS (Domain Name Server) for example http: // www. Yahoo. Com most ISPs will provide standard e-mail address. </P>

<P>This ability to send messages aided the growth of the Internet.  E-mail can be checked anywhere in the world.  Security is a significant concern.  Firewalls are used to securely segment networks.  Filters are used to prevent unsuitable downloads.  Viruses are easily preventable.  Anti-Viral software is freely available.  </P>

<B><U><P>Confidentiality:</P>

</B></U><P>Reveal your personal details with care.  Young people are more trusting and are inclined to reveal more details about themselves.  E-mail is plain text messaging.  Who controls the addresses on the Internet?  The IANA (Internet Assigned Names Authority) is to be gone and taking over by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).  Each country controls its own top-level domain for e.g. .ie Ireland.  Anyone can register a domain name and pay a fee for example .Core</P>
<P>.Net  .Org private individuals may not register their own name.  Companies can register the name of the Company registration is centrally controlled.</P>
