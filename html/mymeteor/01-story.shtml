<h1>News: Meteor Mobile Are Frightened of Little People!</h1>
<h3>Dear All,</h3>
<h3>I've had a problem with Meteor Mobile now for a long time, namely their web SMS service. After much complaining on the phone that got nowhere I put up a web page with all the problems.</h3>
<h3>It was at <b>http://www.fachtnaroe.com/mymeteor/</b> (where you are now). It listed the problems, which are shown below.</h3> 
<h3>Now I've been contacted by Meteor and threatened to <b>Cease and Desist</b>, I believe the phrase is, unless I take down the page. They even threaten a high-court injunction. <b>Cool!</b></h3>
<h3>The story was told on <a href="http://www.enn.ie/blog/index.html?/archives/205-Meteor-hits-mobile-customer.html">http://www.enn.ie/blog/index.html?/archives/205-Meteor-hits-mobile-customer.html</a> and at <a href="http://www.deziddon.com/myMeteor.ie/419">http://www.deziddon.com/myMeteor.ie/419</a> amongst other places.
<h3>Apparently my completely anti-Meteor site "<i>may give rise to the wrong impression that the website is in someway endorsed by Meteor. This confusion may give rise to serious loss and damage to Meteor’s brand, goodwill and reputation</i>"; I mean, how thick would you want to be?</h3>
<h3>Still, they say that "<i>Meteor has expressly raised Mr. Roe’s concerns with its Advanced Product Development team for planned improvements and upgrades to the Webtext service this year</i>" so where phone calls didn't work, a web page did! But "Advanced"? See how basic the issues are down below.</h3>
<h3>But then who's going to trust a phone company or a lawyer - or worse both! Still, a promise is a start and I do believe the guy who phoned to 'threaten' me; after all, he was honest about the legal bit!</h3>
<h3>And their lawyers are good, real good:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Their email was correct automatically marked as <b>[SPAM]</b> and dumped!</li>
<li>They confuse advertisors with owners (so bye, bye all advertising)</li>
<li>They think Clonmel is in Co. Carlow. Oh boy. Explain <i>that</i> one to <a target="_somewhereelse" href="http://www.tipperary-water.ie/">Tipperary Mineral Water</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Anyway, job done; bye, bye old site; welcome to the <strike>new</strike> temporary!</h3>

	<h2><center>If you are a Meteor Customer, the Web SMS service provided is <i>seriously</i> sub-standard.</center></h2>			  
	<h3>		  			  
	<ol>
	<li>I like to organise my contacts tidily, like this:
		<ul><li>Murphy, James</li></ul>
	But the Phonebook no longer accepts that comma after Murphy! It did once, but not any more. <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>What about my friend Paddy O'Reilly? The Phonebook doesn't accept the apostrophe! So much for Irish names being properly stored. <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>In fact, the phone book won't accept any of these characters:
		<ul><li>&amp;$#\"%+/\\*()^!|~`\'=[]{}@;:&lt;&gt;?.,</li></ul>
	 <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>In the Phonebook you cannot <u>edit</u> an entry. You must delete it and then re-enter it if you make a mistake. Life's too short - there's no <u>edit</u> button? <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>Why can't I make a group? I only succeeded once with a test group of three people with the name of the group all in capitals. It never worked again. In uppercase, lowercase or with any number of people, I can't  make a group? <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
<hr width="40%">
<center>Less important from here...</center>
<hr width="40%">
<br>
	<li>If I can't set up a group I can't send a "<u>Group Web Text</u>". <i>A Group Web Text as presented on the website clearly means 1 text to a group.</i> Generous: but that's what they say. After which I should be able to send another 299 messages (single or group ones) that month. Now Meteor are saying that each member of the group counts as one text.<br>To get my texts sent on the 13<sup>th</sup> I had to send my text to everyone in my phone book manually - I had 23 texts left for the month. Meteor are claiming this will be the result of a Group Web Text anyway. Not Fair! <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>Bulk importing of names and numbers was my first complaint to Meteor. I am responsible for a texting list for a national organisation, sending a text about twice a year. When I moved from O<sub>2</sub> I brought the numbers on the list with me and expected to be able to bulk import them - just like with O<sub>2</sub> and away I'd go. But no; that wasn't possible.<p>I phoned 1905 and explained what I wanted to do. I even gave them the necessary information to pass on to their IT department in case they didn't know how to do this. Since then: nothing.<br>Oh! Wait. Not quite true. Apart from no improvement on my first request I found all the other stupid problems above. All I wanted was the same common function provided by other companies websites; still no sign of it. <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>In the Phonebook the entries are <u>not</u> in <u>Alphabetical Order</u>. The entries are grouped by the first letter but not sorted by the second or subsequent letters. They teach sorting in first-year college! It's only a small thing, but <b>Why?</b></li>
