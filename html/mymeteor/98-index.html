<p class="navHeading">If you are a Meteor Customer, the Web SMS service provided is <i>seriously</i> sub-standard.</p>
<ol>
	<li>I like to organise my contacts tidily, like this:
		<ul><li>Murphy, James</li></ul>
	But the Phonebook no longer accepts that comma after Murphy! <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>What about my friend Paddy O'Reilly? The Phonebook doesn't accept the apostrophe! <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>In fact, the phone book won't accept any of these characters:
		<ul><li>&amp;$#\"%+/\\*()^!|~`\'=[]{}@;:&lt;&gt;?.,</li></ul>
	 <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>In the Phonebook you cannot <u>edit</u> an entry. You must delete it and then re-enter it if you make a mistake. Life's too short - there's no <u>edit</u> button? <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>In the Phonebook the entries are <u>not</u> in <u>Alphabetical Order</u>. The entries are grouped by the first letter but not sorted by the second or subsequent letters. They teach sorting in first-year college! It's only a small thing, but <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>Why can't I make a group? I only succeeded once with a test group of three people with the name of the group all in capitals. It never worked again. In uppercase, lowercase or with any number of people, I can't  make a group? <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>If I can't set up a group I can't send a "<u>Group Web Text</u>". A Group Web Text as presented on the website clearly means 1 text to a group. After which I should be able to send another 299 messages (single or group ones) that month. Now Meteor are saying that each member of the group counts as one text.<br>To get my texts sent on the 13<sup>th</sup> I had to send my text to everyone in my phone book manually - I had 23 texts left for the month. Meteor are claiming this will be the result of a Group Web Text anyway. Not Fair! <b>Why?</b></li>
<br>
	<li>Bulk importing of names and numbers was my first complaint to Meteor. I am responsible for a texting list for a national organisation. When I moved from O<sub>2</sub> I brought the numbers on the list with me and expected to be able to bulk import them - just like with O<sub>2</sub> and away I'd go. But no; that wasn't possible.<br>I phoned 1905 and explained what I wanted to do. I even gave them the necessary information to pass on to their IT department in case they didn't know how to do this. Since then: nothing.<br>Oh! Wait. Not quite true. Apart from no improvement to my first request I found all the other stupid problems above. All I wanted was a common function from other companies websites; still no sign of it. <b>Why?</b></li>
