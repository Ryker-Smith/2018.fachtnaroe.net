<p>Dear All,

<p>I've had a problem with Meteor Mobile now for a long time, namely their web SMS service. After much complaining that got nowhere I put up a web page with all the problems.

<p>It's at <a href="http://www.fachtnaroe.com/mymeteor/">http://www.fachtnaroe.com/mymeteor/</a>

<p>Now I've been contacted by Meteor and threatened with legal action unless I take down the page but no solution to my problem.

<p>Any thoughts? Want to email <a href="info@meteor.ie">info@meteor.ie</a> and complain? 

<p>Want to show support in a David and Goliath situation? Direct your email to Gareth Davies.

<p>Regards & Thanks,
<p>Fachtna
