<li>Yet again I am left ADDLED from the ****ing stupid meteor.ie website. I attempted to signup for the Phone a Friend for Free promotion and received system errors and other coldfusion code errors. Whoever the developers are for meteor.ie need a swift kick up the arsehole.</li>
<li> Meteor need to update this website!!<br>
Lots of people are getting annoyed with the meteor website so much so that there is a campaign to try to inform meteor of their problems Vist http://www.fachtnaroe.com/mymeteor/ join the campaign! bug meteor until they do something</li>
<li>I hear the O2 web site works much better. </li>
<li> Flaky<br>
Yes I've also noticed the website is up and down all the time over the last few weeks. I webtext using JSMS and if the Meteor site messes up then texts might not get sent. They need to sort this out fast.</li>
<li>The website says im set up to ring the chosen friend for free. But I still get charged for it. Tried ringing customer care sick of waiting (was on hold and its saturday night).</li>
<li>I've had trouble with the Meteor webtext lately, namely trouble loading the phonebook.</li>
<li>Mr Roe does have a point about apostrophes. They exist as part of many Irish names and systems should be able to deal with them.</li>
<li>Last time I complained about the webtext it was fixed a few days later and a rep called me afterwards to follow up. Perhaps standards are slipping?</li>
<li>Yes, he may have valid points about these being seemingly easy to implement - it's the way he's going about it that's pissed me off anyway.</li>
<li>ah i see. i'm pretty sure she's out of luck i'm afraid. maybe ring them again because meteor aren't known for giving the right answer right away</li>
<li>I think he has a very good point, despite being attacked and banned here on Boards for "spamming". He has contacted the company several times to address a problem which comes down to the basics of web development - stuff a first year programmer would have learned! The company choose to ignore him, and his problem. In the end he was left with no choice but to setup a website similar to Meteor (which is probably the only area where they will get him under the law) stating all the factual problems with the site.
<p>The fact that the company is providing a poor designed website (I always wondered why Customer Service were allowed know your pin, espicaly in the contact us page), fails to listen to its customers wishes (and I believe he isnt the only one asking) and now they are taking legal action against him shows a poor web developer and poor customer relations.
<p>The company deserves the bad publicity imo.</li>
<li>I personally haven't had a problem with the SMS website but I'm not mass texting people I don't know. Maybe if I did I'd have the same problems.</li>
<li>This thread is going way out of hand. I've had a load of reported posts about it.
<p>I'm going to lock it.
<p>Feel free to start a new one about the actual Meteor website, but leave out the stuff about the spammed website, etc.</li>
<li>The spamming was a newbie mistake that he apologised for. Did anyone give him credit for making an apologising? How many posters to the forum are linked to meteor. Some good points were cut to pieces by the same guys even though the points were spot on. You do need apostriophes for Irish names like O'Reilly no m,atter whan the board-bullies say. Mymeteor sucks in parts and thats a fact: face it.</li>
