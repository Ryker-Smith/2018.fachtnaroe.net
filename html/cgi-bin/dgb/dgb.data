But yes, there is a short cut. If you can't find it through the help system I believe it is shown in a later assignment.%NEWLINE%NEWLINEIf you can't wait that long, and I'd prefer you to do things at the pace set out, tell me and I'll let you know the shortcut.%NEWLINE%NEWLINERegards, etc.

I thought and thought and thought making no assumptions about the shocking state of my mental health. And then it hit me. I need a panda. Yep you heard me, A panda. I don't have one. Yet. Anybody else have a panda? I'm certain at least one of you does. But then again I bet that person is always waiting to be told to start so the panda must frustrate them then, they probably see Red. How long could you keep a panda before its tame anyway? I reckon about 9 months. Seems to be about right. In the dead of night does your panda comfort you? I hope so. That's what pandas are for. 
Panda Fan%%%%%%%%1191436096%%213-94-253-193.b-ras1.dbn.dublin.eircom.net%%0%%Some people think that the Panda eats shoots and leaves. Beware! The Panda cannot bear bad grammar.%NEWLINE%NEWLINEA Panda walks into a bar and asks for a sandwich. When the barman refuses to serve him, the Panda takes a bite out of the counter. The barman tells the Panda that they don't serve anyone who takes drugs. The Panda says &quot;What drugs?&quot;. The barman says &quot;I saw that bar-bit-you-ate.&quot;

Sometimes to further hurt or even kill the victim, he or she would then be stabbed or kicked, most notably in the stomach (or in case of kicking, the groin), so that the face would be ripped apart when the victim screams. The practice originated Chelsea, London for Chelsea fans hoping to leave a message to rival football fans.
