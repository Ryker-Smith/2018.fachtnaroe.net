<body>
<p>This illustration shows a slider. A circle that is highlighted in blue represents a movabale element called "thumb." The thumb is positioned on the horizontal body element of the slider that is labeled as the "track." Short vertical lines called "tick marks" indicate 10-unit increments in the track. The minimal value shown is 0.0. The center of the track is at 50.0. The maximum value of 100 is marked as an example of a "tick label." The thumb is positioned at a tick mark that corresponds to 40. The "Block increment" caption indicates the distance between 80 and 90 on the track.</p>
