	<p> 	The ocean doesn't want me today <br>
		But I'll be back tomorrow to play <br>
		And the strangles will take me <br>
		Down deep in their brine <br>
		The mischievous braingels<br>
		Down into the endless blue wine<br>
		I'll open up my head and let out<br>
		All of my time.<br>
		I'd love to go drowning<br>
		And to stay and to stay<br>
		But the ocean doesn't want me today<br>
		I'll go in up to here<br>
		It can't possibly hurt<br>
		All they will find is my beer <br>
		and my shirt<br>
		A rip tide is raging<br>
		And the life guard is away<br>
		But the ocean doesn't want me today<br>
		The ocean doesn't want me today.<br>
