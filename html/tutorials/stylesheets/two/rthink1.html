        If there was ever a way to fold logic back onto itself, then recursion accomplishes this without question. A recursive function is a normal
        function that calls itself before reaching its end. These are useful in calculating sums and factorials, whereby an argument is passed to the
        same function, and the return value is used in the previous function's manipulation. I suddenly realized the other day that this technique
        could be very useful in coding an update for my graphing calculator, the TGC.<br><br>

        For instance, say you had a function called AddFirstThree() that returns the sum of the numbers 1 through 3, and it took an argument
        representing the first number. During the first call, it is obvious that this number will be 1. Here's a little QBasic snippet...<br><br>

        <blockquote><code>
        DIM sum AS INTEGER<br><br>

        sum = AddFirstThree(1)<br>
        PRINT sum<br><br>

        FUNCTION AddFirstThree(x AS INTEGER)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;IF x <> 3 THEN&nbsp;&nbsp; ' If it has reached 3, then don't keep going.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x = x + AddFirstThree(x + 1)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;END IF<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;AddFirstThree = x&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Return the value to where it was called<br>
        END FUNCTION<br>
        </code></Blockquote>

        The code calls AddFirstThree and x becomes 1. Each time it is called within itself, an argument is passed that is 1 added to the value of x.
        So with each successive call, x becomes 2, and the next time it becomes 3. When it becomes 3, it stops calling itself and returns back to
        the next-to-last function. Then it takes that number, adds it to the previous x value that was already in that function, and assigns it to x.
        Then it keeps returning, doing the same thing until it reaches that very first function call, and returns it back to the main submodule.<br><br>

        You may be a little confused. Don't worry, most chimps didn't understand it the first time either. Here's a picture that may help you
        understand it a little better...<br><br>

        Examine that closely. Each time it returns the added portion it adds that to the previous number. You may be wondering what the
        advantages of recursion are. Wouldn't it be easier to just use a standard loop? Yes, but then you couldn't make a debugger's life a
        living hell then could you? If you're interested in spicing up your code, then you won't want to miss the next section.</font><br><br>
