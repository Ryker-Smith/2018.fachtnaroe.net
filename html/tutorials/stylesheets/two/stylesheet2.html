<font face="arial" size="2">

<p>Stylesheets can be implemented in several different ways, and usually one method makes the
most sense for the particular page(s) you are working with.  The most common way is to have
the stylesheet properties embedded into the head of your page with the following code:<p>

<blockquote><code>
<p>&lt;style type=&#148;text/css&#148;&gt;<br>
<br>
h1 { color: green }<br>
p { font-family: arial }<br>
etc...<br>
<br>
&lt;/style&gt;</p>
</code>
</Blockquote>

<p>You can use your personal discretion and decide if you want to expend the extra energy to
include the comments (&lt;!-- --&gt;) around the stylesheet properties. Older browsers (2.0 versions)
may display the actual code if these are not included, but in my humble opinion if you have
someone who visits your site, and they are actually using that old of a browser, some sort of
punishment is definitely in order. I personally do not include the comment tags. <p>

<p>From the example above you can see the basic syntax used in stylesheets. In consists of an HTML tag, an
open brace, followed by the various properties separated by semi-colons, and then closed with another brace. Obviously we will be
spending the majority of our time discussing how to use these properties, so sit tight while we
finish up how to implement the stylesheet.</p>


<p>Another extremely useful feature of CSS is the ability to link to an external stylesheet. If you are
maintaining multiple pages, all with the same layout, then this can prove to be very valuable.
Again, simply include this into the head of your HTML document:<p>

<blockquote><code>
<p>&lt;link rel=&#148;stylesheet&#148; HREF=&#148;stylesheet.css&#148;
type=&#148;text/css&#148;&gt;</p>
</code></Blockquote>

<p>This would reference the file “stylesheet.css” which would contain all the same code that the
above example included. However, these parameters can now be shared across an unlimited
number of pages.<p>

<p>The third way to use stylesheets is to include the code right inside the HTML tag (also called
inline stylesheets). This allows you to set the properties of just that one object on the page. I find
this very useful for form elements which are harder to set correct properties to using the other methods of CSS inclusion.
Take a look at the following code:<p>

<blockquote><code>
<p>&lt;input type=&#148;button&#148; value=&#148;Go&#148; style=&#148;font-size:
17 pt; font-family: verdana&#148;&gt;</p>
</code></Blockquote>

<center>
<input type="button" value="Go" style="font-size: 17 pt; font-family: verdana">
</center>

<p>No longer are you restricted to the generic input button, as you now have virtually the same
control you would have when designing a button in Visual Basic.<p>

<p>The forth and final way of implementing a stylesheet is probably the least used, and maybe the
least useful. This involves importing a stylesheet from an external source. The code looks like
this:<p>

<blockquote><code>
<p>&lt;style type=&#148;text/css&#148;&gt;<br>
@import url(stylesheet.css)<br>
&lt;/style&gt;</p>
</code></Blockquote>


<p>Useful? Perhaps. I would think that you would probably not see many examples of this. This
method is also not supported very well by the various browsers, so maybe this would be a good
time to listen to the advice I gave at the outset. Know about it, but don’t use it just yet.<p>

I know you are chomping at the bit to get to the meat and potatoes of stylesheets, so let us move
on to the good stuff.
