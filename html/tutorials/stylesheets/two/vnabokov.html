          <p class="two">I have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with 
			the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the 
			reader's mind. No matter how many times we reopen "King Lear," never 
			shall we find the good king banging his tankard in high revelry, all 
			woes forgotten, at a jolly reunion with all three daughters and their 
			lapdogs. Never will Emma rally, revived by the sympathetic salts in 
			Flaubert's father's timely tear. Whatever evolution this or that 
			popular character has gone through between the book covers, his fate 
			is fixed in our mind, and, similarly, we expect our friends to follow 
			this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them. 
			Thus X will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the 
			second-rate symphonies he has accustomed us to. Y will never commit 
			murder. Under no circumstances can Z ever betray us. We have it all 
			arranged in our minds, and the less often we see a particular person 
			the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our 
			notion of him every time we hear of him. Any deviation in the fates 
			we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical. 
			We would prefer not to have known at all our neighbor, the retired 
			hot-dog stand operator, if it turns out he has just produced the 
			greatest book of poetry his age has seen.</p>
