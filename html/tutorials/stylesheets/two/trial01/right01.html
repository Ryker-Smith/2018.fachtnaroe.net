 LESSON FOUR: Color and Background Properties 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This shouldn’t be foreign to those familiar with HTML.

b { color: #000000 } 
You can specify color using the name (black, white, green, etc) hexadecimal number (#FF6600) and now RGB value. To set the color using the RGB number use the following code:

a { color: rgb(100, 50, 200) } 
Remember that the number range is from 0 to 255 and the numbers are red, green, and blue, in that order.

Another very cool feature of CSS is the ability to have a background color or image applied to just a specific area of the page. You set the background color just like you did for the fore color, with just the word “background” added.

b { background-color: red } 
You can also set a background image for a specific tag.

p { background-image: url (images/bg.gif) } 
BACKGROUND REPEAT 
Cascading stylesheets also allow you have a background image that tiles only according to specific rules or only appears once.

body { background-repeat: no-repeat; background-image: url(images/bg.gif) } 
You can also set the background-repeat property to repeat-x or repeat-y to have the image tile only across one axis. Setting this value to repeat would cause the image to tile as it normally would.
