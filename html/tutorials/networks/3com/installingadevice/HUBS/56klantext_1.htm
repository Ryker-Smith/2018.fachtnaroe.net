        </b>Indicates possible problems with the LAN Modem. It may light for one 
        of the following reasons:<br>
        - During the power-on self-test diagnostic or after pressing the reset 
        button. Once the unit has passed the diagnostic test and is working properly 
        the ALERT LED will no longer illuminate. <br>
        - A fast flash (five blinks per second) indicates that the DHCP server 
        has issued all of the available IP addresses, and is unable to fulfill 
        a new request. This may happen if you have twenty-five computers attached 
        to the LAN Modem, and you replace one with another computer. </font></p>
