        </b>(top row: 100 Mbps; bottom row: 10 Mbps) If the LED is on, the link 
        between the port and the next piece of network equipment is OK. If the 
        LED is off, nothing is connected, or the connected device is switched 
        off, or there is a problem with the connection (refer to the "Problem 
        Solving" section of your user guide or the "Troubleshooting" section of 
        this CD-ROM. ). If flashing, the port is partitioned, possibly due to 
        a network loop. </font></p>
