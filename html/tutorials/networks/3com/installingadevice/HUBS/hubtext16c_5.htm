        </b>Indicates the status of each port. If the LED is green, the link between 
        the port and the next piece of network equipment is OK. If nothing is 
        connected, the LED is off. If yellow, the port has partitioned due to 
        a fault on that segment. The Coaxial port LED can only be yellow or off. 
        It is yellow if the port has partitioned. </font></p>
