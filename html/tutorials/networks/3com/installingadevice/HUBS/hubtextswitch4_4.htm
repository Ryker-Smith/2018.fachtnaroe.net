        </b>If the <b>Port Status LED</b> is on (green), the link between the

        nothing is connected, or the connected device is switched off, or there 
        is a problem with the connection (refer to the "Troubleshooting" section). 
        The <b>Activity LED</b> flashes (yellow) each time a packet passes through
