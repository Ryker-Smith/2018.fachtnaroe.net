        Duplex and Speed LEDs<br>
        </b>If the link activity LED is on (green), the link between the port 
        and the next piece of network equipment is OK. The LED flashes each time 
        a packet passes through the port. If the LED is off, the port does not 
        have anything connected to it, or the connected device is switched off. 
        If you have made a connection to the port and the LED is off, there may 
        be a problem with the connection (refer to the "Troubleshooting" section). 
        If the Duplex LED is on (yellow), the port is in full duplex mode. If 
        off, it is half duplex. If the Speed LED is on (green), the port is operating 
        at 100Mbps. If off, it is 10Mbps. </font></p>
