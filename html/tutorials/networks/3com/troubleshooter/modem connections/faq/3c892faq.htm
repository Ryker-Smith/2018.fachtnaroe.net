<A NAME="WhatisaOCLM"></A> <BR>
<B>Q. What is a LAN Modem?</B> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Typically, most people 
  start out with just one workstation with a modem attached. As their needs grow, 
  and they require more workstations, it becomes necessary to network your workstations 
  together, and to share modems and phone lines. This is where the LAN Modem comes 
  in. It allows you to network your workstations together, and share the modem 
  between them. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The LAN modem is essentially 
  an ISDN router with a built-in Ethernet hub. It eliminates the COM port speed 
  bottleneck (because the LAN is running at 10 Mbps in comparison to a 115 Kbps 
  or 230 Kbps serial port rate), and at the same time provides local networking 
  (for file and printer sharing) between the attached workstations. <BR>
  <A NAME="WhatOS"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. What Operating Systems does the LAN Modem support?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. The LAN Modem supports 
  all operating systems with a TCP/IP stack, which includes Windows 95/98 and 
  NT, Apple Macintosh, Unix and Linux. To configure the LAN Modem, the only software 
  you need on your PC is a web browser. <BR>
  <A NAME="Whatprotocols"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. What protocols work with the LAN Modem?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. The LAN Modem supports 
  all networking protocols (such as IP, IPX and AppleTalk) on the local LAN. However, 
  only IP traffic is passed over the ISDN connection. <BR>
  <A NAME="HowMany"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. How many workstations can I connect to the LAN Modem?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. The LAN Modem has a built 
  in 4 port hub. However, you can connect the LAN Modem to a hub. This allows 
  you to connect the LAN Modem to large networks with many workstations. The limitation 
  is that only 25 workstations on the LAN can use the LAN Modem for ISDN access 
  to the Internet or remote network. It makes no difference whether the workstations 
  are directly connected to the LAN Modem or connected to a hub that is connected 
  to the LAN Modem. An OfficeConnect 
  hub is an ideal way to connect 25 workstations to your LAN. <BR>
  <A NAME="ExistingIP"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Can I plug the LAN Modem into my existing IP-based LAN?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes, however, consider 
  the following. It is best to connect the LAN Modem to one PC initially, to ensure 
  successful configuration. The LAN Modem will need a static IP address and subnet 
  mask that is in the range of the rest of your network. If you already have DHCP 
  server functionality on your existing IP-based LAN, or if you are using static 
  IP addressing, then disable the DHCP server on the LAN Modem. Please refer to 
  the User Guide for more information. <BR>
  <A NAME="ExistingNonIP"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Can I plug the LAN Modem into my existing non IP-based LAN?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. However, you will 
  have to install a TCP/IP stack and a Web browser on each of the workstations. 
  After you have installed TCP/IP and a Web browser, refer to the <I>Getting Started 
  Guide</I> for the instructions on setting up TCP/IP and configuring the LAN 
  Modem. <BR>
  <A NAME="25Users"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Can I plug the LAN Modem into my LAN with 40 workstations? Only 25 of 
  them need Internet access.</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. All 40 workstations 
  can participate in local networking on the LAN, but only 25 can access the Internet. 
  To successfully configure your LAN, you need to follow the following steps: 
  </font>
<OL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> You need to select a 
    suitable subnet mask for your LAN. A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 will give 
    you 254 addresses (0 and 255 are broadcast addresses). Please refer to other 
    sources for information on TCP/IP and subnet masks.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> You must select up to 
    25 workstations to have access through the LAN Modem.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If you currently have 
    a DHCP server on the LAN you should disable it. The LAN Modem gives access 
    to workstations based on IP address; if the IP address of the workstation 
    changes (and it can if you use DHCP) it will no longer have Internet access.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The LAN Modem must be 
    given a static IP address. The default IP address of the LAN Modem is 192.168.1.1. 
    You could allocate addresses in the range 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254 to 
    your workstations.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On each of the selected 
    25 workstations, enter the workstation's unique IP address (selected from 
    the above range), the gateway address (192.168.1.1), the DNS address (192.168.1.1) 
    and the subnet mask (255.255.255.0).</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On each of the other 
    15 workstations, enter the workstation's unique IP address (selected from 
    the above range), DNS server (192.168.1.1) and subnet mask (255.255.255.0). 
    There is no need to enter a gateway address, since these workstations do not 
    have access to the Internet or Private Network.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Go to the LAN Modem's 
    main configuration screen. Click on <I>LAN Parameters</I>. Enter the unique IP 
    address assigned to the LAN Modem (if different from its default address of 
    192.168.1.1), the subnet mask (255.255.255.0) and disable the DHCP server. 
    Click the <I>Submit</I> button.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The IP addresses of 
    the 25 selected workstations must now be configured on the LAN Modem. To do 
    this, go to the LAN Modem's main configuration screen, 
    and click on <I>Workstations</I>. Go to each workstation entry in turn, and 
    enter the IP address of each of the 25 workstations. Remember to check the 
    box labeled <I>IP Address Statically Configured on Workstation</I>.</font></LI>
</OL>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><A NAME="100BaseT"></A> <BR>
<B>Q. Can I plug the LAN Modem into my 100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet) LAN?</B> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Not directly. The LAN 
  Modem only supports 10BASE-T (10 Mbps). If you want to connect the LAN Modem 
  to your LAN you'll need a switch that converts 100BASE-TX to 10BASE-T, such 
  as an OfficeConnect Dual Speed Switch.<BR>
  <A NAME="DiffDest"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Can my LAN Modem connect to two different destinations simultaneously?</B> 
  </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. You can configure 
  the LAN Modem so one B channel goes to your Internet Service Provider, and the 
  second channel goes to your office. The LAN Modem will intelligently route information 
  to the correct destination. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Also, if you configure 
  both connections to use <I>Add Second B-Channel As Required</I>, the LAN Modem 
  has a unique feature&#151;Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation! For example, if you 
  have both B channels connected to your Internet Service Provider, and you launch 
  an application that requires a connection to your office, the LAN Modem will 
  automatically drop one of the B channels to your Internet Service Provider and 
  establish a connection with your office. <BR>
  <A NAME="RemoteDialin"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Can I setup the LAN Modem for remote dial-in?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. No. The LAN Modem cannot 
  receive incoming calls from sites that need to access servers on the LAN. The 
  LAN Modem can only receive incoming data calls for the following purposes: </font>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remote management of 
    the LAN Modem</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Downloading the latest 
    firmware to the LAN Modem</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reviewing the LAN Modem's 
    statistics</font></LI>
</UL>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Incoming calls for data transfer 
are not supported. For example, you cannot call into the LAN Modem to use a computer 
as a server that others would dial into and use for downloading information.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>
<A NAME="SendFaxes"></A> <BR>
<B>Q. Can I send and receive faxes with my LAN Modem?</B> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. No. However, you can 
  connect a fax machine to one of the phone ports of the LAN Modem, and send and 
  receive faxes that way. <BR>
  <A NAME="Modem"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Can my LAN Modem dial into an analog modem?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. No. Your LAN Modem uses 
  ISDN, which is digital. It cannot connect to an analog modem. <BR>
  <A NAME="CAPI"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Does the LAN Modem support CAPI?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. No. CAPI is the Common 
  ISDN Application Programming Interface. It is used where the workstation has 
  sole control of the ISDN device. The LAN Modem is shared amongst many workstations, 
  so CAPI support is not possible. <BR>
  <A NAME="LatestFirmware"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. How can I check to see if my LAN Modem is using the latest firmware?</B> 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. From your LAN Modem's 
  main configuration screen, go to <I>Statistics</I>, then <I>System</I>. Look 
  for the <I>System software version</I> number. The latest firmware is 5.2.0. 
  If you are not using the latest firmware you should upgrade your LAN Modem to 
  obtain all the latest features.<BR>
  <A NAME="Y2K"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Is the LAN Modem Year 2000 compliant?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. </font> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>
  <FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><b>The LAN (Local Area Network)</b></FONT></font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>
  <A NAME="StaticDynamic"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. What is the difference between Static Assigned IP addressing and Dynamic?</B> 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. IP addresses for public 
  networks must be unique and provided by the Network Information Center (NIC). 
  Because of the increasing popularity of the Internet, the NIC is running out 
  of permanent IP addresses. It is therefore becoming more common to use dynamic 
  IP addresses which are assigned temporarily and then reused, rather than static 
  IP addresses which are permanent. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For example, when accessing 
  the Internet, your Internet Service Provider has a pool of IP addresses it uses 
  to provide temporary connections to multiple users. Once you disconnect from 
  the Internet, the IP address you were using is placed back in the pool for use 
  by another user. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If your LAN will not connect 
  to the public Internet, you can set up your own unique (that is, private) IP 
  address numbering. IP addresses for private networks such as an office LAN must 
  also be unique but only within that LAN. <BR>
  <A NAME="IPdynamically"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Do my workstations need to be configured to get an IP address dynamically 
  from a DHCP server?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. No. If your network is 
  already using static IP addressing there is no need to change your addressing 
  scheme. However, on <U>each</U> workstation, you should ensure that the first 
  DNS server entry exactly matches the IP address specified as the workstation's 
  gateway address. When the LAN Modem is attached to the computer, the LAN Modem 
  will automatically change its IP address to match what you specify in the Gateway 
  IP address on your computer's TCP/IP setting. Since the LAN Modem will learn 
  and use the Gateway IP address specified on your computer, make sure that IP 
  address is not being use by any other workstation on the LAN. For more information, 
  refer to the LAN Modem <I>User Guide.</I><BR>
  <A NAME="AlertLED"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Why does the Alert LED blink rapidly for a few seconds every now and then?</B> 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. In 5.2.0 firmware, another 
  function was added to the operation of the Alert LED. If the LAN Modem sees 
  a DHCP request on the LAN that it is unable to fulfil, the Alert LED will blink 
  rapidly for a few seconds. This will happen under two conditions. Firstly, if 
  you have disabled the LAN Modem's DHCP server, and are using another DHCP server 
  on the LAN, every time a DHCP request is made the Alert LED will blink rapidly 
  for a few seconds. The second case where this can happen is if you've attached 
  more than 25 workstations on your LAN and filled up the LAN Modem's DHCP table.

  For more information on DHCP, click <A HREF="#HowDoesDHCPWork">here</A>. <BR>
  <A NAME="ServerApplications"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Can I run server applications on this LAN?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes, you can run server 
  applications <U>within</U> the LAN. However, you cannot remotely dial into the 
  LAN Modem to access the servers; dial-in is used for remote management only. 
  If the LAN Modem initiates a call, you can configure one server to be the "default 
  workstation" for that Service Provider. This way, all incoming packets not initiated 
  from the workstations on the LAN will be directed to that one server. <BR>
  <A NAME="PCAnywhere"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Can I run <i>PC Anywhere</i> on a workstation on the LAN, and connect 
  to it from the Internet?</B> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. Go to the LAN Modem's 
  main configuration screen. Click on <i>Service Providers</i> and select the 
  entry for your Internet Service Provider. Click on <i>Select</i>. Scroll down 
  the page until you get to <i>Default Workstation</i>. Make sure this is the 
  PC on the LAN that is running PC Anywhere. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When the LAN Modem is connected 
  to the Internet, go to the LAN Modem's main configuration screen. Click on <i>Statistics</i>, 
  then <i>Current Call</i>. <i>IP address in use</i> gives the IP address assigned 
  to the LAN Modem by the Internet Service Provider. When you use PC Anywhere 
  to connect to this IP address, the LAN Modem will forward the packets to the 
  default workstation. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Your Internet Service Provider 
  might be able to assign your LAN Modem the same IP address every time it connects. 
  This will eliminate the need to look up the IP address assigned to LAN Modem 
  every time you wish to run PC Anywhere. Speak to your Internet Service Provider 
  for more information on this. <BR>

  <B>Q. Upon initial set-up, communication between the LAN Modem and my computer 
  cannot be established.</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. This may be caused by 
  one of the following. </font>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The wrong cable may 
    be connected to the LAN port on the LAN Modem and your computer. Make sure 
    you are using the 8-pin to 8-pin cable labeled <I>Ethernet</I> that was provided 
    with your LAN Modem. If you are using another 10BASE-T Ethernet cable, it 
    must be a straight-through cable. Make sure that the LAN status LED corresponding 
    to the port to which your computer is connected is lit, indicating that the 
    LAN Modem detects the Ethernet signal and operation is normal.</font></LI>

    you can do one of two things. Firstly, you can set your idle timeout lower 
    than the frequency at which NetBIOS automatically generates packets. A setting

  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> An inability to connect 
    both channels of a Multilink PPP call may be due to an incompatibility with 
    the router into which you are dialing. Some service providers may split the 
    two B channels of a Multilink PPP call between different routing devices, 
    preventing the channels from being linked together. This is usually most prevalent 
    during high peak hours. If you are unable to establish a Multilink PPP call, 
    try reconnecting your call during off-peak hours. If you are still unable 
    to establish a Multilink PPP call, contact your Internet Service Provider

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There are a number of things 
  to check if Tollmizer doesn't work: </font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Line provisioning</b>

    You ISDN line must be provisioned to allow voice calls. Check with you phone 
    company to ensure this is the case.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The path your call 
    takes through the telephone network</b> <br>
    Sometimes the phone company routes voice calls through an older, non-digital 
    section of its network, preventing you from passing data over the line.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The remote router</b> 
    <br>
    The router you are connecting to must be configured to treat voice (analog) 
    calls as digital calls. Sometimes your Service Provider might give you the 
    same phone number for both 56K modem and ISDN calls - in this case, incoming 
    voice calls are treated as analog calls, and will be routed to a modem bank. 
    If this happens, Tollmizer won't work. Check with your Service Provider to 
    ensure voice calls are treated as digital calls.</font></li>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Password Authentication 
  Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) are used 
  to pass your username and password to the remote router. When the LAN Modem 
  dials the remote router it will automatically negotiate the authentication protocol, 
  and will use which ever authentication protocol the remote router requests. 
  The LAN Modem will prefer to do CHAP (which encrypts your password), so if the 
  remote router supports CHAP then this is what will be used. <BR>

  <B>Q. Why doesn't CHAP (encrypted authentication) work when using Windows NT 
  4.0?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Earlier versions of LAN

  <A NAME="CompressionDoesntWork"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Why can't I get PPP data compression to work?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Although the LAN Modem 
  uses a standard type of compression, Hi/fn&#153; (formerly STAC) compression, 
  and other vendors' equipment also supports Hi/fn, sometimes the implementations 
  do not fully adhere to the specification. Therefore, you may experience problems 
  with compression when dialing into some routers. If you experience problems 
  with compression, change the value of the <I>Data Compression</I> field to No 
  in your service provider profile. <BR>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Ascend changed their 
  compression algorithm between version 5 and 6 of their firmware. If the Ascend 
  you are dialing into has version 5.00A or earlier, set the compression on the 
  Ascend to MS-STAC. If the firmware is 5.00P12 or later, set the compression 
  to STAC-9. The STAC setting on Max and TNT routers is proprietary, and will 
  only work between Ascend routers. <BR>
  <A NAME="TempSP"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. What is <i>TempSvcProvider</i> used for?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. In the <i>Manual Calling</i> 
  screen, there is an entry called <i>TempSvcProvider</i>. This entry is used 
  to make a test call to a <i>Service Provider</i> to verify that a connection 
  can be made to it. Only the workstation making the test call can pass data to 
  the remote location. Should other workstations on the LAN wish to pass data

  <A NAME="CallerIDWork"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. How does Caller ID work?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. In contrast to how Caller 
  ID works over a plain ordinary telephone service (POTS) line, where it is delivered 
  as a V.23 modem signal between the 1st and 2nd ring cycles, Caller ID over an 
  ISDN line is delivered over the D (signaling) channel at the initial onset of 
  call setup in compliance with ITU-T specification Q.81.3. However, ISDN Caller 
  ID will not contain any time stamp information. The LAN Modem, in processing 
  the Caller ID signal, superimposes its own internal clock (date and time) signal 
  and outputs the combined information to the POTS port(s) as a V.23 signal, allowing 
  conventional Caller ID display units to function. This information, like an 
  ordinary POTS line, is generated between the 1st and 2nd rings. If the time 
  displayed with the call is incorrect it is because the LAN Modem's internal 
  clock is incorrect and since the LAN Modem gets its date and time info from 
  the workstation, it is likely that the workstation's date and time is incorrect. 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In most cases, you need 
  to subscribe to the Caller ID service from your phone company. They may charge 
  a fee for this service. If you have subscribed to the Caller ID service, but 
  the Caller ID box attached to the LAN Modem is not displaying the Calling Party's 
  number, take a look at <I>Statistics</I>, <I>Last/Current Call</I>. If the <I>Calling 
  Telephone Number </I>is not present, then check with your phone company to see 
  if you have Caller ID on your line. If the <I>Calling Telephone Number </I>is 
  displayed, check that your Caller ID box is attached to the correct analog port 
  of the LAN Modem, and is functioning correctly. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When both B channels are 
  in use, Caller ID will not be presented to the Caller ID box. This is a limitation 
  of the hardware. The LAN Modem has two Serial Communication Controllers (SCC's). 
  A single SCC is needed to generate the Caller ID information, but both are needed 
  to pass data to the B channels. <BR>
  <A NAME="CallerIDNames"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Does the LAN Modem support Caller ID names?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. If the phone company 
  sends the LAN Modem the name of the person calling, the LAN Modem will present 
  that information to the Caller ID box. Both your Caller ID box attached to the 
  phone port of your LAN Modem and your phone company have to support Caller ID 
  names for this to work. <A HREF="#LatestFirmware">Make sure</A> you are using 
  the latest firmware. <BR>
  <A NAME="DistinctiveRing"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Does the LAN Modem support distinctive ringing?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. The phones attached 
  to the phone ports of the LAN Modem can be made to give a distinctive ring; 
  when a voice call is routed to one of the LAN Modem's phone numbers, it can 
  be made to ring differently to a call to the other phone number. To enable distinctive 
  ringing, go the the LAN Modem's main configuration screen. Click on <I>ISDN 
  Parameters</I> and enable <I>Distinctive Ringing</I>. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This is similar to distinctive 
  ringing on an ordinary analog phone line; in this case you would have one line 
  with up to 3 phone numbers assigned to that one line. Depending on the number 
  dialed, a ring distinguishing one number from the others is generated by the 
  phone company. <BR>
  <A NAME="NoDialToneInternet"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. Why can't I get a dial tone from the telephone while I am connected to 
  the Internet?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. When setting up your 
  Internet Service Provider connection, if you set Bandwidth Allocation to <I>Use 
  two B channels</I>, your ISDN connection will be nailed up for a two data channel 
  connection. Because both B channels are in use, there is no bandwidth available 
  for the voice call. To be able to place a voice call while connected to the 
  Internet, under Bandwidth Allocation for this service provider profile, select 
  <I>Use one B channel</I> or <I>Add second B channel as required</I>. <BR>

  <B>Q. Why can't I get dial tone from the telephone when I know that one B channel

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. If your line is provisioned 
  on a Nortel DMS-100&reg; switch, then regardless of the ISDN Ordering Code you 
  choose, you cannot have simultaneous voice and data on the same phone number 
  because of a limitation with the central office switches. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When you make a Multilink 
  call (using the <I>Add second B channel as required</I> setting), and pick up 
  the phone, the first B channel (corresponding to your first phone number) is 
  dropped. If you picked up the phone connected to port 1, you would get dial 
  tone. However, if you picked up the phone connected to port 2 you would not 
  get dial tone because that phone number would be used by the data call. <BR>

  <B>Q. Why can't my PC Card (or PCMCIA) modem detect dial tone?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Some modems, when sampling

  the LAN Modem is intelligent enough to direct the server's response to that 
  workstation. However, if a second workstation is sending e-mail to the same 
  server, then the server's response will be discarded, because the LAN Modem 
  does not know which of the two (or more) workstations is needs to forward the 
  response to. After 30 seconds, the SMTP server will again respond, this time 
  using the port number specified by the workstation. When this happens, the sending 
  of the e-mail will commence. So, occasionally, you might see a 30-second delay 
  before your e-mail is sent. </font>

  When requested by a workstation, the LAN Modem will issue the workstation with 
  an IP address, DNS address, gateway address, and IP &quot;lease&quot;. The DNS 
  and gateway addresses will be the IP address of the LAN Modem. The IP lease 
  will be 24 hours&#151;meaning the workstation will need to re-request an IP

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The IP lease is <U>not</U>

<A NAME="HowDoesDNSWork"></A> <BR>
<B>Q. How does the LAN Modem's DNS server work?</B> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. The LAN Modem has a built-in 
  DNS server. This increases it's functionality and simplicity when compared to 
  other routers, most of which don't have a built-in DNS server. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The LAN Modem's DNS server 
  can resolve local names, and &quot;lanmodem&quot;. When a Windows PC makes a 
  DHCP request, it sends its name to the LAN Modem. The LAN Modem associates this 
  name with the IP address it issued, and uses it to resolve local machine names. 
  For example, instead of typing &quot;ping 192.168.1.2&quot;, you can just type 
  &quot;ping Fred'sPC&quot;. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The LAN Modem also resolves 
  &quot;lanmodem&quot; (or &quot;http://3com.oc.lanmodem&quot;) to be its own 
  IP address. This allows you to type &quot;lanmodem&quot; as the URL in your 
  browser to bring up the LAN Modem's configuration screen. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The LAN Modem will also 
  return its own IP address to any DNS request if it has not yet been configured. 
  This means that when you first connect to your unconfigured LAN Modem you will 
  see the LAN Modem's configuration screen no matter what your browser's start 
  page is. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Having a built-in DNS server 
  has another advantage. You can define the domain of your office connection (for 
  example, &quot;3com.com&quot;) in your <i>Service Provider</i> configuration 
  on the LAN Modem. This way, the LAN Modem can resolve all DNS requests ending 
  in the defined suffix (for example, &quot;my_private_server.3com.com&quot;) 
  by forwarding the DNS request to your office's DNS server, instead of to the 
  Internet Service Provider's DNS server. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To take advantage of the 
  LAN Modem's built-in DNS server, make sure that the DNS server on all your workstations 
  is set to the LAN Modem's IP address. If your workstations get their IP address 
  via DHCP this is done automatically. <BR>
  <A NAME="HowDoesNATWork"></A> <BR>
  <B>Q. How does NAT (Network Address Translation) work?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. In a typical scenario 
  of the LAN Modem dialing an Internet Service Provider, the Internet Service 
  Provider will dynamically assign the LAN Modem an IP address. The LAN modem 
  will translate the source IP address in Internet-bound IP packets to this valid, 
  routable Internet IP address. When a packet is received from the Internet, the 
  reverse process happens; the Internet Service Provider-assigned IP address is 
  replaced with the IP address of the workstation to which that packet is directed. 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For example, assume the 
  workstation (192.168.1.2) is browsing (TCP/UDP port 80) the 3Com web site (192.156.136.22), 
  and was assigned a dynamic IP address of 136.22.36.12 by the Internet Service 
  Provider. Note the source port number is generated randomly by the workstation, 
  and is normally above the <I>well known ports</I> (RFC 1700). </font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last NAT scenario is 
  the one of an unsolicited incoming packet. This can happen with online chat 
  / video, where you register your availability to chat with a &quot;reflector&quot; 
  site. A good example of the is CU-See Me video conferencing software from White 
  Pine Software. Once registered, anyone on the internet is free to communicate 
  with your workstation. If they do, the LAN Modem will receive an unsolicited 
  packet, and will not know which workstation to route it to. In this case it 
  will be passed to the workstation given as the default (under <I>Service Provider</I> 
  configuration). <BR>

  <B>Q. What is the difference between a <I>Private Network</I> and an <I>Internet 
  Service Provider</I>?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. When configuring a Private 
  Network, you are able to specify the network address of the remote LAN. When 
  the LAN Modem sees a packet on the LAN that is destined for an address not on 
  the local LAN it will look in the Service Provider tables to decide where to 
  route the packet to. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The LAN Modem first looks 
  though the Private Network entries to see if the packet matches the specified 
  network address of a remote LAN. It starts from the first Service Provider profile, 
  and continues through to the last. If the packet matches the remote network 
  address, the packet will be routed to that Private Network. Of course, if there 
  is no data call currently up to that Private Network, then one will be made. 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If there is no match among 
  the Private Network profiles, the LAN Modem will route a packet to the first 
  Internet Service Provider entry it finds. In networking terms, the Internet 
  Service Provider can be considered a &quot;default route&quot;. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There are deviations from 
  this logic: </font>
<OL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If a call is already 
    up to a Private Network, and you have internet access through that network, 
    then the LAN Modem will route the packet to the Private Network, instead of 
    bringing up a call to the Internet Service Provider.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When deciding where 
    to route a packet to, the LAN Modem will skip over Service Providers that 
    the workstation has been denied access to. To allow or deny a workstation 
    access to a Service Provider, click on <I>Workstations</I> and select the 
    workstation in question. Select the Service Provider(s) that the workstation 
    had access to.</font> </LI>
