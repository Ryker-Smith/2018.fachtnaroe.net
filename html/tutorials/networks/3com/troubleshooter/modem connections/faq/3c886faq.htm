<B>Q. What is a LAN Modem?</B> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Typically, most people 
  start out with just one workstation with a modem attached. As their needs grow, 
  and they require more workstations, it becomes necessary to network your workstations 
  together, and to share modems and phone lines. This is where the LAN Modem comes 
  in. It allows you to network your workstations together, and share the modem 
  between them. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The LAN modem is essentially 
  an analog router with a built-in Ethernet hub. <BR>
  <A name=WhatOS></A><BR>
  <B>Q. What Operating Systems does the LAN Modem support?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. The LAN Modem supports 
  all operating systems with a TCP/IP stack, which includes Windows 95/98 and 
  NT, Apple Macintosh, Unix and Linux. To configure the LAN Modem, the only software 
  you need on your PC is a web browser. <BR>
  <A 
name=Whatprotocols></A><BR>
  <B>Q. What protocols work with the LAN Modem?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. The LAN Modem supports 
  all networking protocols (such as IP, IPX and AppleTalk) on the local LAN. However, 
  only IP traffic is passed over the modem connection. <BR>
  <A name=HowMany></A><BR>
  <B>Q. How many workstations can I connect to the LAN Modem?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. The LAN Modem has a built 
  in 4 port hub. However, you can connect the LAN Modem to a hub. This allows 
  you to connect the LAN Modem to large networks with many workstations. The limitation 
  is that only 25 workstations on the LAN can use the LAN Modem for ISDN access 
  to the Internet or remote network. It makes no difference whether the workstations 
  are directly connected to the LAN Modem or connected to a hub that is connected 
  to the LAN Modem. An OfficeConnect hub is an ideal way to connect 25 workstations 
  to your LAN. <BR>
  <A 
name=ExistingIP></A><BR>
  <B>Q. Can I plug the LAN Modem into my existing IP-based LAN?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes, however, consider 
  the following. It is best to connect the LAN Modem to one PC initially, to ensure 
  successful configuration. The LAN Modem will need a static IP address and subnet 
  mask that is in the range of the rest of your network. If you already have DHCP 
  server functionality on your existing IP-based LAN, or if you are using static 
  IP addressing, then disable the DHCP server on the LAN Modem. Please refer to 
  the <I>User Guide</I> for more information. <BR>
  <A name=ExistingNonIP></A><BR>
  <B>Q. Can I plug the LAN Modem into my existing non IP-based LAN?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. However, you will 
  have to install a TCP/IP stack and a Web browser on each of the workstations. 
  After you have installed TCP/IP and a Web browser, refer to the <I>Getting Started 
  Guide</I> for the instructions on setting up TCP/IP and configuring the LAN 
  Modem. <BR>
  <A name=25Users></A><BR>
  <B>Q. Can I plug the LAN Modem into my LAN with 40 workstations? Only 25 of 
  them need Internet access.</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. All 40 workstations 
  can participate in local networking on the LAN, but only 25 can access the Internet. 
  To successfully configure your LAN, you need to follow the following steps: 
  </font>
<OL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You need to select a 
    suitable subnet mask for your LAN. A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 will give 
    you 254 addresses (0 and 255 are broadcast addresses). Please refer to other 
    sources for information on TCP/IP and subnet masks. </font>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You must select up to 
    25 workstations to have access through the LAN Modem. </font>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you currently have 
    a DHCP server on the LAN you should disable it. The LAN Modem gives access 
    to workstations based on IP address; if the IP address of the workstation 
    changes (and it can if you use DHCP) it will no longer have Internet access. 
    </font>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The LAN Modem must be 
    given a static IP address. The default IP address of the LAN Modem is 192.168.1.1. 
    You could allocate addresses in the range 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254 to 
    your workstations. </font>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On each of the selected

    the above range), DNS server (192.168.1.1) and subnet mask (255.255.255.0). 
    There is no need to enter a gateway address, since these workstations do not 
    have access to the Internet or Private Network. </font>

<B>Q. My LAN needs more bandwidth. Can I have 2 LAN Modems on the same LAN?</B> 
</font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes. Essentially you'll 
  be dividing your LAN into two logical halves, with some workstations using one 
  LAN Modem, and the rest using the other. It is not possible to combine the bandwidth 
  of the two LAN Modems. Here's how to go about configuring this: </font>
<P align=center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><IMG alt="" border=0 height=255

<OL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The LAN Modems have the 
    same default IP address. You will need to change one of them to a different 
    value. Using the above example, you can change the IP address of one of the 
    LAN Modems to 192.168.1.2. </font>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You might need to select 
    a different subnet mask for your network. In the above example, a value of

<B>Q. Can I plug the LAN Modem into my 100Base-TX (Fast Ethernet) LAN?</B> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Not directly. The LAN 
  Modem only supports 10BaseT (10 Mbps). If you want to connect the LAN Modem

<A name=SendFaxes></A><BR>
<B>Q. Can I send and receive faxes with my LAN Modem?</B> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. No. However, you can 
  connect a fax machine to the phone port of the LAN Modem, and send and receive 
  faxes that way. <BR>
  <A name=CAPI></A><BR>
  <B>Q. Does the LAN Modem support CAPI?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. No. CAPI is the Common 
  ISDN Application Programming Interface. It is used where the workstation has 
  sole control of the ISDN device. The LAN Modem is shared amongst many workstations, 
  so CAPI support is not possible. <BR>
  <A name=LatestFirmware></A><BR>
  <B>Q. How can I check to see if my LAN Modem is using the latest firmware?</B> 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. From your LAN Modem's 
  main configuration screen, go to <I>Statistics</I>, then <I>System</I>. Look 
  for the <I>System software version</I> number. The latest firmware is 7.1.0. 
  If you are not using the latest firmware you should upgrade your LAN Modem to 
  obtain all the latest features.<BR>

  <B>Q. What is the difference between Static Assigned IP addressing and Dynamic?</B> 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. IP addresses for public 
  networks must be unique and provided by the Network Information Center (NIC). 
  Because of the increasing popularity of the Internet, the NIC is running out 
  of permanent IP addresses. It is therefore becoming more common to use dynamic 
  IP addresses which are assigned temporarily and then reused, rather than static 
  IP addresses which are permanent. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, when accessing 
  the Internet, your Internet Service Provider has a pool of IP addresses it uses 
  to provide temporary connections to multiple users. Once you disconnect from 
  the Internet, the IP address you were using is placed back in the pool for use 
  by another user. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If your LAN will not connect 
  to the public Internet, you can set up your own unique (that is, private) IP 
  address numbering. IP addresses for private networks such as an office LAN must 
  also be unique but only within that LAN. <BR>
  <A name=IPdynamically></A><BR>
  <B>Q. Do my workstations need to be configured to get an IP address dynamically 
  from a DHCP server?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. No. If your network is 
  already using static IP addressing there is no need to change your addressing 
  scheme. However, on <U>each</U> workstation, you should ensure that the first 
  DNS server entry exactly matches the IP address specified as the workstation's 
  gateway address. When the LAN Modem is attached to the computer, the LAN Modem 
  will automatically change its IP address to match what you specify in the Gateway 
  IP address on your computer's TCP/IP setting. Since the LAN Modem will learn 
  and use the Gateway IP address specified on your computer, make sure that IP 
  address is not being use by any other workstation on the LAN. For more information, 
  refer to the LAN Modem User 
  Guide.<BR>
  <A name=AlertLED></A><BR>
  <B>Q. Why does the Alert LED blink rapidly for a few seconds every now and then?</B> 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. In 7.1.0 firmware, another 
  function was added to the operation of the Alert LED. If the LAN Modem sees 
  a DHCP request on the LAN that it is unable to fulfil, the Alert LED will blink 
  rapidly for a few seconds. This will happen under two conditions. Firstly, if 
  you have disabled the LAN Modem's DHCP server, and are using another DHCP server 
  on the LAN, every time a DHCP request is made the Alert LED will blink rapidly 
  for a few seconds. The second case where this can happen is if you've attached 
  more than 25 workstations on your LAN and filled up the LAN Modem's DHCP table.

  <B>Q. Can I run server applications on this LAN?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Yes, you can run server 
  applications <U>within</U> the LAN. However, you cannot remotely dial into the

  dials the remote router it will automatically negotiate the authentication protocol, 
  and will use which ever authentication protocol the remote router requests. 
  The LAN Modem will prefer to do CHAP (which encrypts your password), so if the

  other vendors' equipment also supports Hi/fn, sometimes the implementations 
  do not fully adhere to the specification. Therefore, you may experience problems 
  with compression when dialing into some routers. If you experience problems 
  with compression, change the value of the <I>Data Compression</I> field to <i>No</i>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, some routers will 
  not negotiate Hi/fn™ compression during PPP negotiation when V42bis compression

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. This is a limitation 
  of <A 
href="#HowDoesNATWork">NAT</A>. When mail is sent to a SMTP server, the server 
  often responds using a different port number to that originally supplied by 
  the workstation. If there is only one workstation actively sending email, the 
  LAN Modem is intelligent enough to direct the server's response to that workstation. 
  However, if a second workstation is sending e-mail to the same server, then 
  the server's response will be discarded, because the LAN Modem does not know 
  which of the two (or more) workstations is needs to forward the response to. 
  After 30 seconds, the SMTP server will again respond, this time using the port 
  number specified by the workstation. When this happens, the sending of the email 
  will commence. So, occasionally, you might see a 30-second delay before your 
  e-mail is sent. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The workaround for this

  When requested by a workstation, the LAN Modem will issue the workstation with 
  an IP address, DNS address, gateway address, and IP "lease". The DNS and gateway 
  addresses will be the IP address of the LAN Modem. The IP lease will be 24 hours,

<B>Q. How does the LAN Modem's DNS server work?</B> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. The LAN Modem has a built-in 
  DNS server. This increases it's functionality and simplicity when compared to 
  other routers, most of which don't have a built-in DNS server. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The LAN Modem's DNS server 
  can resolve local names, and "lanmodem". When a Windows PC makes a DHCP request, 
  it sends its name to the LAN Modem. The LAN Modem associates this name with 
  the IP address it issued, and uses it to resolve local machine names. For example, 
  instead of typing "ping 192.168.1.2", you can just type "ping Fred'sPC". </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The LAN Modem also resolves 
  "lanmodem" (or "http://3com.oc.lanmodem") to be its own IP address. This allows 
  you to type "lanmodem" as the URL in your browser to bring up the LAN Modem's 
  configuration screens. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The LAN Modem will also 
  return its own IP address to <U>any</U> DNS request if it has not yet been configured. 
  This means that when you first connect to your unconfigured LAN Modem you will 
  see the LAN Modem's configuration screens no matter what your browser's start 
  page is. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having a built-in DNS server 
  has another advantage. You can define the domain of your office connection (for 
  example, "3com.com") in your <I>Service Provider</I> configuration on the LAN 
  Modem. This way, the LAN Modem can resolve all DNS requests ending in the defined 
  suffix (for example, "my_private_server.3com.com") by forwarding the DNS request 
  to your office's DNS server, instead of to the Internet Service Provider's DNS 
  server. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To take advantage of the 
  LAN Modem's built-in DNS server, make sure that the DNS server on all your workstations 
  is set to the LAN Modem's IP address. If your workstations get their IP address 
  via DHCP this is done automatically. <BR>
  <A name=HowDoesNATWork></A><BR>
  <B>Q. How does NAT (Network Address Translation) work?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. In a typical scenario 
  of the LAN Modem dialing an Internet Service Provider, the Internet Service 
  Provider will dynamically assign the LAN Modem an IP address. The LAN modem 
  will translate the source IP address in Internet-bound IP packets to this valid, 
  routable Internet IP address. When a packet is received from the Internet, the 
  reverse process happens; the Internet Service Provider-assigned IP address is 
  replaced with the IP address of the workstation to which that packet is directed. 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, assume the 
  workstation (192.168.1.2) is browsing (TCP/UDP port 80) the 3Com web site (192.156.136.22), 
  and was assigned a dynamic IP address of 136.22.36.12 by the Internet Service 
  Provider. Note the source port number is generated randomly by the workstation, 
  and is normally above the <I>well known ports</I> (RFC 
  1700). </font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Intelligent NAT</I> (under 
  <I>Service Provider</I> configuration) adds some intelligence to NAT. Some server 
  applications might choose to reply using a different port number. With <I>Intelligent 
  NAT</I> enabled the LAN Modem will attempt to route the packet to the workstation 
  currently communicating with that server. It searches its NAT table for a match 
  of the server's IP address, and then routes the packet to the workstation that 
  previously communicated with that server. Of course, if there is more than one 
  workstation communicating with that one server, the LAN Modem will be unable 
  to determine which workstation the packet should be sent to; in this case it 
  will go to the first workstation where the match is first made. For this reason, 
  applications (like Microsoft's <A 
href="#NetMeeting">NetMeeting</A>) 
  that respond using a different port numbers will only work on one workstation 
  on the LAN. To work around this NAT limitation, the second workstation should 
  connect to a different server, if possible. </font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last NAT scenario is 
  the one of an unsolicited incoming packet. This can happen with online chat 
  / video, where you register your availability to chat with a "reflector" site. 
  A good example of the is CU-See Me video conferencing software from White Pine 
  Software. Once registered, anyone on the internet is free to communicate with 
  your workstation. If they do, the LAN Modem will receive an unsolicited packet, 
  and will not know which workstation to route it to. In this case it will be 
  passed to the workstation given as the default (under <I>Service Provider</I> 
  configuration). <BR>

  <B>Q. What is the difference between a <I>Private Network</I> and an <I>Internet 
  Service Provider</I>?</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. When configuring a Private 
  Network, you are able to specify the network address of the remote LAN. When 
  the LAN Modem sees a packet on the LAN that is destined for an address not on 
  the local LAN it will look in the Service Provider tables to decide where to 
  route the packet to. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The LAN Modem first looks 
  though the Private Network entries to see if the packet matches the specified 
  network address of a remote LAN. It starts from the first Service Provider profile, 
  and continues through to the last. If the packet matches the remote network 
  address, the packet will be routed to that Private Network. Of course, if there 
  is no data call currently up to that Private Network, then one will be made. 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If there is no match among 
  the Private Network profiles, the LAN Modem will route a packet to the first 
  Internet Service Provider entry it finds. In networking terms, the Internet 
  Service Provider can be considered a "default route". </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are deviations from 
  this logic: </font>
<OL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If a call is already 
    up to a Private Network, and you have Internet access through that network, 
    then the LAN Modem will route the packet to the Private Network, instead of 
    bringing up a call to the Internet Service Provider. </font> 
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When deciding where to 
    route a packet to, the LAN Modem will skip over Service Providers that the 
    workstation has been denied access to. To allow or deny a workstation access 
    to a Service Provider, click on <I>Workstations</I> and select the workstation 
    in question. Select the Service Provider(s) that the workstation had access 
    to.</font></LI>
