<H1>Restoring accidentally deleted files</H1>

The CDCR have the capabilities of restoring deleted data from its image or 
incremental backups.  If you delete any data, the CDCR will try and recover 
that data.  However, we cannot be held responsible for you deleting your data, 
unless the fault is clearly ours.
<p>
The main purpose of the backup schedule is to restore a disks image in the 
event of a serious system crash etc.  It also enables the CDCR to provide a 
user support for deleted data.  The user should understand that this is a 
bonus facility, and cannot be guaranteed.
<p>

Your account data is stored in a user partition.  This partition is backed up every 48hrs and
there are a series of 9 tapes used to backup this partition.  At some point, that tape will be
used to backup over again, so if you require a restore, fill out the form and return it ASAP. 
The longer you leave it, the less tapes there are available to restore from and the greater the
possibility of failure.  Every other day an incremental backup is done.  This backs up the data
that has been changed since the last image backup. 

<p>

A restore request form is provided, and can be found in room 26BB20 by the telephone.  Once you
have filled this form in, return to either <a href="http:/showstaff?Parsons">John Parsons</a>,
or to room 25BB20.  You will be given a reference number to use for any queries concerning your
restore. 

<p>

<b>PLEASE NOTE</b>, a restore will not be done unless you fill out the 
necessary paperwork.
