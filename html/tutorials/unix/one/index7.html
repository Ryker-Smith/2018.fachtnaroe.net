<BODY>
<H1>Creating commands and  programs using the shell</H1>

<P>As well as using the shell to run commands you can use its
built-in programming language to write your own commands or
programs.  You can put commands into a file - known as a <EM>shell
script</EM> - and then execute that file as you would a command or
program.</P>

<P>The use of the Bourne shell (sh) is illustrated as this is
available on all UNIX systems. Bourne shell scripts will
also work under the Bourne Again SHell.  The C and TC
shells use a programming language which is similar to the
C programming language.</P>
