<H1>What is a file?</H1>

<P>A file is a collection of letters, numbers and special
characters: it may be a program, a database, a dissertation,
a reading list, a simple letter etc.</P>

<P>Sometimes you may import a file from elsewhere, for
example from another computer.  If you want to enter your
own text or data, you will start by creating a file.</P>

<P>Whether you copied a file from elsewhere or created your
own, you will need to return to it later in order to edit
its contents.</P>
