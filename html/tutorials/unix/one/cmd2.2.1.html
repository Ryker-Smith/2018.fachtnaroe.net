<H1>Examples of quoting special characters</H1>

<P>To remove the special meaning from a single
metacharacter:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>rcp ubik:/home/roger/recipe.ps .;\\</STRONG>&lt;Return&gt;
   <STRONG>lpr -Pps3 #6m recipe.ps</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This prevents the shell from expanding the newline
character generated by  pressing the <SAMP>&lt;Return&gt;</SAMP> key. You
can then continue entering the command on the next line.</P>

<HR>

<P>To prevent the shell from expanding an argument
containing several special characters:

<PRE WIDTH=80>   $ <STRONG>sed -e 1,$s/V[0-9].*: //p /etc/motd</STRONG>
   sed: command garbled: 1,/V[0-9].*:
   $ <STRONG>sed -e '1,$s/V[0-9].*: //p' /etc/motd</STRONG>
   DYNIX/ptx(R) Tue Feb 25 12:04:15 GMT 1993
</PRE>

<P>First, the shell tries to expand the command line and
changes its meaning in the process. When the arguments to
the command are protected by enclosing them in single
quotes the <STRONG>
 <A HREF="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sed">sed</A>
</STRONG> command is successful. It displays the
operating system version number contained in the message
of the day.</P>

<HR>

<P>To prevent the shell from expanding special characters
but allow command substitution:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>echo 'My working directory is `pwd`'</STRONG>
   My working directory is`pwd`
   <STRONG>echo "My working directory is `pwd`"</STRONG>
   My working directory is /home/jane/docs
</PRE>

<P>When enclosed within single quotes the characters <SAMP>`pwd`</SAMP>
 are treated literally as part of the string to be echoed.
Placed within double quotes, the command within the
backquotes is executed and its output substituted in its
place.</P>
