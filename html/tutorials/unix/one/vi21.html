<P>To replace one word in the current line with
another:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>:s/that/which</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This replaces the first instance of the word "that" in
the current line with the word "which".</P>

<HR>

<P>To replace every instance of one word in the
current line with another:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>:s/destroy/delete/g</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This replaces every occurrence of the word "destroy" with
the word "delete" in the current line.</P>

<HR>

<P>To replace every occurence of a word throughout the
file,  with another:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>:g/insert/s//add/g</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This replaces every occurence of "insert" with "add".</P>

<HR>

<P>To interactively replace every occurence of a
word throughout the file, with another:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>:g/in conjunction with/s//with/gc</STRONG>
   option used in conjunction with the ls command
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</PRE>

<P>This displays the first line containing an occurence of
the pattern "in conjunction with", and identifies this
occurence by underlining each character with a ^ (caret).</P>

<P>Entering <STRONG>y</STRONG> (yes) replaces this instance of "in
conjunction with" by "with" and proceeds on to the next.</P>
