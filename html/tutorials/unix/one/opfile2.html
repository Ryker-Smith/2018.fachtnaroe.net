<H1>Directories</H1>

<P>A directory is a file that holds other files and other
directories.  You can create directories in your home
directory to hold files and other sub-directories.</P>

<P>Having your own directory structure gives you a definable
place to work from and allows you to structure your
information in a way that makes best sense to you.</P>

<P>Directories which you create belong to you - you are said to
"own" them - and you can set 
 <A HREF="../tasks/access_permissions.html">access permissions</A>
 to control which other users can have access to the information they
contain.</P>
