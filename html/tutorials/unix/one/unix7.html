<H1>UNIX shell commands</H1>

<P>You can run UNIX commands and see their output without
leaving vi. You can also insert the output of a UNIX
command into the file you that are editing.</P>

<P>To run a single UNIX command use the command:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>:!<EM>UNIX_command</EM></STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>You can start a shell from within <STRONG>vi</STRONG> and use it as
you would your usual UNIX environment, then exit the
shell and return to <STRONG>vi</STRONG>.</P>

<P>To start up a shell enter the command:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>:sh</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>The type of shell that is started is determined by the
<SAMP>$SHELL</SAMP> variable.  You can specify that some other shell is
to be started by setting the <STRONG>vi</STRONG> 
<A HREF="eleven.html"><SAMP>shell</SAMP> option</A>.</P>

<P>Return to using <STRONG>vi</STRONG> by entering the command 
<STRONG>exit</STRONG> or <SAMP>Ctrl-D</SAMP>.</P>

<P>To insert the output from a UNIX command into a file,
immediately after the cursor:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>:r!<EM>command</EM></STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>For example, this facility would be very useful if you
were using <STRONG>vi</STRONG> to document a UNIX command and you wanted
to include examples of the output from this command.</P>
