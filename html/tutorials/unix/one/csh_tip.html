<H1>C Shell: Tip...</H1>

<P>If a shell and an environment variable have the same
name, the value of the local shell variable will be used.
You can avoid problems by making sure that shell and
environment variables with the same name are set to the
same value in your <SAMP>.cshrc</SAMP> (<SAMP>.tcshrc</SAMP>).</P>

<P>For example, suppose you set the following variables in
this order in your <SAMP>.cshrc</SAMP> (<SAMP>.tcshrc</SAMP>) file:</P>

<PRE>   setenv TERM vt100
   ...
   ...
   set term=xterm
</PRE>

<P>When a shell is invoked, the value of the environment
variable TERM is copied into the shell variable term.
But the value of this shell variable is set later on
in the <SAMP>.cshrc</SAMP> (<SAMP>.tcshrc</SAMP>) file, and it is this
value which is then copied back into the environment value TERM
which is then exported to the general environment.</P>
