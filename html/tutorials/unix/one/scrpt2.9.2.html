<H1><SAMP>trap</SAMP>: Handling command lists</H1>

<P>The command list is placed between single quotes, as the
command line is scanned twice, once when the shell first
encounters the trap command and again when it is being
executed.</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>trap '<EM>command-list</EM>' <EM>signal-list</EM></STRONG>
</PRE> 

<P>The single quotes inhibit immediate command and variable
substitution but are stripped off after the first scan,
so that the commands are processed when the command is
actually executed.</P>

<P>If <EM>command-list</EM> is not specified, then the action taken
on receipt of any signal in the <SAMP>signal-list</SAMP> is reset to
the default system action.</P>

<P>If <EM>command-list</EM> is an explicitly quoted null command
(' ' or " "), then the signals in <SAMP>signal-list</SAMP> are ignored
by the shell.</P>

<P>The <EM>command-list</EM> is treated like a subroutine call.  The
commands in the list are executed when the signal is
trapped and control is then returned to the place at
which it was interrupted.</P>
