<H1>Processes</H1>

<P>When you enter a command it invokes a program.  While
this program is running it is called a <EM>process</EM>.  It is
important to grasp that although there is only one copy
of a program held in the <A HREF="bin.html">file system</A>,
any number of processes can be invoked which run this program.</P>

<P>When the operating system is started after a 
<A HREF="gb.html#boot">boot</A>, a
single process is started. This process is the parent of
all subsequent processes.  Each process created on the
system has a unique number, known as its 
<A HREF="pid.html">PID</A>, associated with it.</P>

<P>When you
 <A HREF="basic1.html">login</A> to the system a process is
started to run your <A HREF="index12.html">shell</A> program. Any
processes that are started from within your shell - such as entering a 
 <A HREF="index8.html">command</A> - are the
children of this process.  A process can have many
children, but only one parent.</P>

<P>See <A HREF="jobz.html">Managing jobs and processes</A>
 for further information.</P>
