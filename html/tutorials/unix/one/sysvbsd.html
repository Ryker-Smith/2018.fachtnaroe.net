<H1>Modern variants of UNIX</H1>

<P>There are two main versions of UNIX in use today: <STRONG>System
V</STRONG> and <STRONG>BSD</STRONG>. System V is the more popular of the
two.</P>

<P>From a user's perspective they are very similar and you are unlikely
to have difficulty unless you use more than one type of system. In this
case you might notice differences in the
<A HREF="strctfile.html">structure of the file system</A> or in how
certain commands behave. The <A HREF="index9.html">on-line
manual</A> should be helpful if you have problems.</P>

<P>Although UNIXhelp is now based on a System V variant of UNIX, you
should see only minor differences in the example input and output if
your system is a BSD one.</P>
