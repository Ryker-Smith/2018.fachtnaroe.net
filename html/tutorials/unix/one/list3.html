<H1>Listing hidden files</H1>

<P>The command</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>ls -a</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>lists all the "hidden" files that begin with a '.' (dot).
All other files and directories are also listed.</P>

<P>This type of file is often created by you, the user, to
hold commands that customise how a particular program is
to work.  These files are usually held together in your
home directory.</P>

<P>Every directory has two dot files, '.' and '..' which
can be used in a shorthand way to refer to the current
directory '.'(dot) and the parent directory of the
current directory '..' (dot dot).</P>
