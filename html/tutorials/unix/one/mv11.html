<H1>**Caution**</H1>

<P>Take care what name you give to the file or directory
that the file or directory is being moved to.</P>

<P>If you choose the name of a file or directory that
already exists it will be replaced by the file or
directory that has been moved to its name!</P>

<H2>To avoid this ...</H2>

<P>Always use the mv command together with its <STRONG>-i</STRONG>
option. This will prompt you for confirmation whenever
the moved file or directory would overwrite an existing
file or directory.</P>

<P>**The <STRONG>i</STRONG> option is not available with some versions of the
command.**</P>

<P>Check the <A HREF="../manual/man_org4.html">manual page</A>
for the <STRONG>mv</STRONG> command on your system.</P>
