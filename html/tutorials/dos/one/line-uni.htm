<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Batch Files: Isolating a Unique Line</H2>

<P>Honestly, this is basic use of the FIND command. There are no tricks.
The goal here is to separate a single line in a file or command output
by finding something different about it. Using FIND, that line can then
be singled out. For example, in the DIR command, the line which contains
the total size of all files contains the word &quot;file(s)&quot;:<BR>
<B><TT>9 file(s) 173,558 bytes<BR>
</TT></B>A command such as <BR>
<B><TT>DIR | FIND &quot;file(s)&quot; <BR>
</TT></B>would extract that single line. Sometimes it may be necessary
to string FINDs together. Some miscreant might create a file with the name
&quot;file(s)&quot;, and that would mess you up. Adding a reverse search
for &quot;:&quot; would eliminate files from consideration (assuming your
DIR output lists file creation times): <BR>
<B><TT>DIR | FIND &quot;file(s)&quot; | FIND /V &quot;:&quot;<BR>
</TT></B>Separating out just a single line gives you the most flexibility.
