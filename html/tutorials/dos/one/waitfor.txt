  This batch file will repeatedly ping a site until it 
  comes up. You can select how often it will be pinged 
  by changing the number on the 
  choice /c:pq /n /t:p,10 > nul 
  line. Right now I have it set for a 10-second delay. 
  Right now I also have it set to ping 
  "ftp.netscape.com", and you will want to change that 
  to something like MyFriend.dyn.ml.org". Finally, I 
  set it to run NOTEPAD after the ping proves good. 
  You'll want to set it to launch something more useful!
  If you aren't using Winsock2, you may want to update 
  your PING command so it won't hang you. See
