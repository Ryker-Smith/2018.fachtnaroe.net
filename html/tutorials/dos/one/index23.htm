<td>I needed to create self-running slide shows for training purposes.
Each slide would be associated with audio narration. I wanted them to be
able to be run from a floppy disk or the web. I formed an early dislike
of Microsoft's PowerPoint because of the way it blanked the screen while
loading -- and loading might take a while on floppies or over the web.
So I looked into other methods. Here I'll share what I found.&nbsp;
<p><b><a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/slideshow/vb/index.htm">Visual Basic</a></b>&nbsp; Written a long
time ago, this was my first slide show effort. It needs only a list of
pictures and sounds. It automatically advances to the next picture after
the sound finishes. Separate versions are included (with source code) for
Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. Great for kiosk-type presentations. Compatible
with the Microsoft "PC Speaker Driver" for computers without a sound card.&nbsp;
<p><b><a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/slideshow/manualadvance">JavaScript Manual Advance</a></b>&nbsp; It
works. Runs on my 3 browsers (IE 5.0, Netscape 4.72, NeoPlanet 5.1) and
uses no browser-specific code. All the navigation code is in a separate
frame. This means you can display pictures or web pages as part of your
presentation without modifying them.&nbsp;
<p><b>Everything below this point is still being developed! Presentation
descriptions may not match actual features, download links may be missing,
or presentations may only be three page demos. If you like it, grab it,
but expect me to make changes over the next couple months.</b>
<p><b><a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/slideshow/autoadvance">JavaScript with Automatic Advance</a></b>&nbsp;
This should only be considered where download time is stable or insignifigant.
Like ummm... play it from your hard drive or over a fast intranet connection.
The slide advance timing is preset by you (the creator) and has to take
download time into consideration. I set the timings in this show for my
28.8 dialin to my ISP. I'm betting your connection has a longer route and
you may get the last second or two of audio cut off. Which shows you why
you really should limit this to your hard drive or in-building LAN. Consider
this demonstration code. Read on to see solutions to the download time
problem.&nbsp;
<p><b><a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/slideshow/truespeech">JavaScript with TrueSpeech</a></b>&nbsp; Improving
the JavaScript slide show under Netscape by streaming the audio with TrueSpeech.
With streaming, we no longer have to take download time into consideration.
The TrueSpeech plugin is a little quirky, but that's half the fun. When
IE is used, it uses it's native MediaPlayer streaming audio player. Neither
solution, of course, will work for my Linux friends.
<p><b><a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/slideshow/mplayer">JavaScript with Microsoft MediaPlayer</a></b>&nbsp;
Improving the JavaScript slide show under Netscape by streaming the audio
with the Microsoft Media Player. As long as your Netscape end users can
follow directions to install the Media Player <b>and</b> it's associated
plugin, they can use the same streaming audio player used in IE. Again,
the use of MediaPlayer will probably be less than successfull with Linux
users.
<p><b><a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/slideshow/buffered">JavaScript with Buffering</a></b>&nbsp; Improving
the JavaScript slide show under Netscape by buffering. By buffering the
audio (and pictures), presentations play just as well as if they were on
your hard drive. The buffering only works on Netscape, but that's the only
place it is really needed. The good part is that there is no need to have
Netscape users install any plugins. When IE is used, it uses it's native
MPlayer2 streaming audio player, so the lack of buffering under IE isn't
a real problem.&nbsp;
<p><b><a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/slideshow/events">JavaScript with Events</a></b>&nbsp; About as far
as I can go. Again using Microsoft's MediaPlayer, but this time I sink
the MediaPlayer "PlayStateChange" event to tell when the audio clip has
finished playing. As a result, you no longer have to specify slide advance
timings.
