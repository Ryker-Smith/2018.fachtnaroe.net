<TD WIDTH="100%">I loved Stacker right up until I lost my entire drive.
After multiple uses of "UNDELETE" and "CHKDSK" turned everything into "FILExxxx.CHK"
files, I wrote UNCHK, which opens all files with "CHK" extensions in a
specified directory and looks through them on sector boundaries for known
file headers. When UNCHK finds a header, it copies everything into a new
file with the appropriate extension (for example to FILExxxx.GIF). The
original CHK file is never modified. UNCHK will search for GIF, JPG, ZIP,
WRI, DOC, EXE, and BMP files. You can add more file types by modifying
it's INI file.&nbsp;

<P>So what is a CHK ("check") file? Well, any time a program or Windows
crashes, any files that were open are not closed properly. Part of closing
is writing all the file location information in all the right places. Without
this info, Windows can't find all the parts of the file. When SCANDISK
or CHKDISK is run, all the parts are identified as "lost file fragments"
and converted (if you want) into CHK files. Face it. Stuff crashes all
the time. If you only run SCANDISK once a month, you get a month's worth
of old crash junk. If you were working on (and lost) something important
just before a crash, you might want to try to recover any data from any
CHK files that exist. On the other hand, if you aren't in a state of panic
over lost data, just delete any CHK files. A handy tip: Keep your disk
defragged. That way if you ever do lose it all, the lost file fragments
will be more likely to be complete files.&nbsp;

<P>How do you add more file types to look for? Just add them to the UNCHK.INI
file. What you're looking for is to see if the first few bytes in a certain
file type are fixed. For example, the first four bytes in a GIF file are
always "GIF8".&nbsp; You just add new extensions and the first couple bytes
from a file of that type, and it will be searched for. Here's what UnChk
starts out with:&nbsp;

<P><B><TT>JPG=&yuml;&Oslash;&yuml;&agrave;</TT></B>&nbsp;
