<p>Before you can send an attachment to somebody, you have to know four
things about them. The easiest way to tell is usually to have a few canned
test messages you can send to see what they can handle. Obviously, the
major effort lies with you to be able to send the same thing in the many
different ways that may be required! Regardless of how bad things seem,
there are standalone mail encoding/decoding programs freely available on
the Internet that will allow you to send or receive anything to or from
anybody. Some examples of <b>free</b> encoders or decoders are <a href="http://www.hotfiles.com/?0001ES">WinCode</a>,
<a href="ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack/mpack15d.zip">MPack</a>,
and
<a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/decode/netsend1.zip">NetSend.</a>
One of my favorite decoders is the shareware program <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</a>.
<p>Here are the four questions:
<p><b><font color="#993366"><font size=+1>(1) WHAT CAN THEY DECODE?</font></font></b>&nbsp;
This is usually <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/Uuencode.htm">UU</a>
(Unix), <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/text/faq/usenet/mail/mime-faq/top.html">MIME</a>
(Netscape), or <a href="http://www.browncs.com/binhex.html">BINHEX</a>
(Macintosh). If you use Microsoft Outlook, you have to worry if they can
decode the <a href="index24.htm">MS-TNEF</a> format Outlook uses
to send attachments. Some mail programs can't decode any attachment formats!
All attachments have to be encoded somehow before they can be sent over
the Internet. The encoding converts a "binary" attached file to a "plain-text"
file, and plain text is the only thing that is guaranteed to pass through
all networks along the way. Obviously, once you encode it, they have to
decode it. Otherwise they see the random-looking encoded text. When things
work correctly, you never know about the encoding. You attach something,
and they see your attachment. Neither of you knows or cares about how it
gets encoded.
<p><b><font size=+1><font color="#993366">(2) HOW BIG A MESSAGE CAN THEY
HANDLE?</font><font color="#663366"> </font></font></b>Common answers range
from 32k and 64k (Default Windows text and integer limitations) to 10 megs
(mail account disk space limitations). I've crashed many a mail program
and corrupted many a file by trying to send or receive something bigger
than allowed. Amazingly, the maximum allowed size is almost never mentioned
in any documentation.
<p><b><font size=+1><font color="#993366">(3) CAN THEY HANDLE MULTIPLE
ATTACHMENTS?</font><font color="#663366">&nbsp;</font></font></b> Some
email programs will only get the first attachment if you send several in
the same message. Some others have a limit as to how many attachments they
will accept. If this becomes a problem, you'll either have to send each
attachment separately or archive them all together in one file (Then you
have to worry about if they can un-<a href="http://www.matisse.net/files/formats.html">ZIP,
ARJ, LHA, ARC, PAK, or TAR</a> whatever it is you sent them...).
<p><b><font color="#993366"><font size=+1>(4) CAN THEY COMBINE SPLIT ATTACHMENTS?</font></font></b>Sometimes
you'll be stuck sending something that is bigger than either you can send
or the other person can receive. The only thing that can be done is to
split the file into smaller parts. This is so common that many mail programs
handle the splitting, naming (1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc.) and concatenating automatically.
But most mail programs can't do it at all!

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Now... Here are a couple tricks you can use when you have to send something
to someone whose capabilities you don't know. The "Catch-22" you get caught
in is this: If you encode something, the other person has to have a decoder.
If they don't have a decoder, you can't send them one, because you have
to encode it to send it and they can't decode it!
<p>If the person you are sending to has BASIC (Even the <a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/olddos.exe">QBASIC</a>
that has been included free with MSDOS since version 5.0), you can embed
the text from <a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/mail/uudecode.bas.txt">UUDECODE.BAS</a> in your message.
To make sure UUDECODE.BAS isn't itself encoded, you'll have to include
it in the BODY of your message. You'll have to instruct the recipient to
save your message with just the lines with line numbers to a separate file
named UUDECODE.BAS. Do it by cutting and pasting or whatever, but be sure
to save it as "plain text". Then start whatever BASIC program is available
and open UUDECODE.BAS wherever it was stored. When UUDECODE is run, it
will ask for the input file (the saved message with the uu-encoded file
in it) and the output file (the name of the attachment). If you're smart,
the first thing you'll send is a better decoding program so the recipient
won't have to use UUDECODE.BAS ever again. Even smarter is to send a small
decoding program just in case the person has a size problem.
<p>Another approach is to send whatever you want as a self-extracting program
in text format. How is this done? Well, less than half of the PC instructions
use bytes that can be printed out as text, but an enterprising programmer
named Jim Tucker used those few commands to build build a full encoder/decoder/extractor
program. It's called <a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/decode/netsend1.zip">netsend</a>,
and as long as the recipient can figure out how to clip text, they can
get whatever you send them. Well, since COM files can't be any bigger than
64k, that limits you to sending small files. But it's still a big help!
Netsend can also produce a "mini uu decoder" (called muud.com) which, because
it is plain text, can be sent to people in the body of a message! Click
<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/mail/smallduck.txt">here</a>
to see an actual output from netsend where I've encoded one of my graphics
called "smallduck.gif".
<p>Of course, there are always other "gotchas" waiting for you. For example,
if the person you are sending to has Outlook, they might have security
set up to not even show certain types of attachments. If you send to an
AOL account, AOL might convert multiple attachments into a single zipped
attachment. Or maybe the other guy's mail client will foolishly trigger
on some word in your message. Like sending a line with nothing but a period
on it might end your message. Or sending the word "begin" followed by two
spaces could hide your message.
