        <td width="100%">I need to launch programs, batch files,
        and scripts automatically. I don't have Microsoft &quot;Plus!&quot;,
        so I can't use System Agent. I don't have Norton, so
        their scheduler is also out of the question. I do have
        McAfee, but their scheduler is the most unreliable
        commercial program I've ever seen. And every piece of
        downloadable software I could find came with a nasty
        shareware nag screen or made itself an unwelcome guest on
        my task bar. So I wrote my own scheduler.<p>The Schedule
        program has no user interface because it really doesn't
        need one. Setting up the specs on what programs get
        launched is handled by an INI file. A GUI doesn't add
        much to this simple process. The only remaining item
        where a GUI might be handy is to shut the program down.
        But I elected to let the sytem kill the program via the
        task manager (hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete, select &quot;Schedule&quot;,
        and &quot;End Task&quot;). So I got out of all the bother
        with a GUI. The best part of no GUI is no window. That
        means no task bar or system tray clutter. If you want,
        Schedule will keep a log of program launches (including
        it's own start and stop times).</p>
        <p>Schedule is a Visual Basic program and needs the <a
        href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/MSVBVM50.EXE">Microsoft
        VB5 Runtime files</a>&nbsp; which you probably already
        have. So I didn't include them in the download! To get
        the Schedule program, the ReadMe file, and source code,
        click the &quot;Download Now!&quot; icon at the top of
        this page. </p>
