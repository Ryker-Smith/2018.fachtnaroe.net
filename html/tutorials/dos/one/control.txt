Many times you will have an automated process running that 
you want shut down at a certain time of day. What you are 
asking is a generic "How can I control another program in 
Windows" question. I have a few suggestions. 

First, Win98 has built-in scripting. You can use Microsoft's 
VBScript or JScript. Allegedly you can use Perl, but I haven't 
seen an example. Amazingly, the scripting will run on Win95 
& NT and is available as a free download. See
http://www.microsoft.com/scripting

Second, there is a program called WinBatch that allows you 
to do lots of things. I played with it a few years ago and 
it seemed to work as advertised. See

Third, I wrote a program that can be used to crudely script 
other Windows programs. Basically. it can send keystrokes. 
No programming. Just two functions: "AppActivate" gives focus 
to a window and "SendKeys" sends keystrokes. See

Finally, the time of day problem. Your basic approach here 
is to schedule a program to run at a certain time of day. 
This scheduled program (Script, WinBatch, SlideShow) will 
then kill your other program.

Frankly, you might want to read the Windows help on the 
"System Agent". I don't use it, but I think it is capable 
of scheduling programs. McAfee and Norton Antivirus both 
include a scheduler as well. There are other schedulers 
available like PC Magazine's free one. See
