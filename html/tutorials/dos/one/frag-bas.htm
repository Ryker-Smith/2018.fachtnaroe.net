Creating Line Fragments Using QBASIC</H2></CENTER>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><I>QBASIC can create a "line fragment" (a line without
the usual carriage-return) with a PRINT statement and a semicolon. If we
create the BASIC program on-the-fly, maybe we can still consider it "Batch
Programming".&nbsp;</I>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER>


<P>We'll create the program by ECHOing lines into a .BAS file (Actually,
the file doesn't have to have a BAS extension, but it does have to have
some kind of extension. QBASIC is picky about that.).

<P><B><TT>echo open "fragment.txt" for output as #1 > script.bas</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>echo print #1,"set value="; >> script.bas</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>echo close #1 >> script.bas</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>echo system >> script.bas</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>qbasic /run script.bas</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>del script.bas > nul</TT></B>

<P>The object of the above code is first to create a basic program called
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>script.bas</FONT></B>. When script.bas is run, it will
in turn create a one-line file called <B><FONT SIZE=+1>fragment.txt</FONT></B>,
our desired "line fragment". Fragment.txt will be just the single line
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>set value=</FONT></B> with no carriage return or linefeed.
Let's examine the script.bas file which will be created. Since most of
it is human-readable, I'll only cover the trick spots. The semicolon on
the <B><FONT SIZE=+1>print</FONT></B> line is what suppresses the addition
of the carriage return to the end of the line. Don't you wish DOS had a
simple option like that? <B><FONT SIZE=+1>System</FONT></B> is used instead
of the more widely-known "end" at the end of the program because system
will not only stop the program, it will shut down QBASIC as well. Finally,
the <B><FONT SIZE=+1>/run</FONT></B> option for QBASIC allows QBASIC to
immediately load and run the specified file.

<P>The only bad part of using QBASIC is that your screen will flash briefly
as it loads.
