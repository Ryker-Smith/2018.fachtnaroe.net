<td WIDTH="100%"><b>Good news - I found a more stable alternative to the
programs I've written here.</b> It's called WGET and can retrieve files
via HTTP and FTP <i>and</i> it can resume aborted downloads. I found out
about it at the <a href="http://member.intraware.com/free/wget.html">Intraware</a>
site when I was downloading some Informix drivers. <b>Get it <a href="http://sunsite.dk/wget/">here</a>.</b>
Or you're still welcome to read on and get the tools I wrote...
<p>I needed to automate the download of data from a web site. There didn't
seem to be any way to do it. So I had to write a program. WebGet can be
run from a DOS batch file or from the Windows Scripting Host (Or VBA or
any ActiveX client). It can retrieve text or binary files under both the
HTTP and FTP protocols. Although it is technically a Windows program, there
is no user interface. Click the "Download Now!" icon to get the WebGet
program, source code, and sample DOS and VBScript code.&nbsp;

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">--- Keep Reading! ---</font></b></center>

<p>I hate to mention this, but some users have reported (and I've confirmed)
that there are some webservers that the WebGet program seems to retrieve
only the first 1 or 2 kb of data from. My feeling is that this is due to
a too-large MTU setting on the webserver resulting in packet fragmentation
which confuses the MSINET control. Just a guess. Maybe it doesn't like
the chunking that some servers do. But basically it works for me on the
servers I use. So there.
<p>Ouch! And now I find out the darned thing doesn't work at all under
Windows 98. Okay, so it still works for me under Windows 95. I use it (automated)
about ten times a day. So that makes it your problem. Ha!
<p><b>Here's my compromise.</b> I had another project I was working on.
It retrieves http files (no ftp), but it doesn't use the MSINET control
that I bet is causing at least half the problems. It uses the MSWINSCK
control, and even though it is still very basic, it is way more stable.
I mean it gets full pages where WebGet gets half pages, and it works on
Windows 98. I call it "Post" (I don't bother trying to come up with creative
names), and you can get it <b><a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/webget/post.zip">here</a></b>. It works
with both the http "POST" and "GET" methods. The "WebGet" program only
did "GET".&nbsp;
<p>Like everything I have, it comes with samples and source code. And there's
a good chance it will solve your problem if you need to automate the download
of web pages.</td>
