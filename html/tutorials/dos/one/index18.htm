<TD WIDTH="100%">I needed to automate the download of certain files by
email. Lucky for me, the Exchange server I needed to hit supported the
POP3 mail protocol that almost everybody uses. So I was able to write a
very generic tool. You can run it standalone (see the picture below), or
you can automate it via Windows Scripting, DOS batch files, or any VBA
client!
<P>In addition to all the advantages automation offers, this program solves
three other common problems even if you don't use automation:
<UL>
<LI>
First, it can identify "spam". Nothing is foolproof, but I figure if&nbsp;
a message isn't addressed to you and the clown who sent it used someone
else's mail server, it's spam. You can delete all of it in one shot if
you want.</LI>

<LI>
Second, it can delete (or just skip) those modem-choking huge messages
you sometimes get. How many times have you set your work email to auto-forward
to your home account just to check in and find you have three 15 megabyte
databases you don't need. With this program, you can delete those nasty
pigs without touching your other mail. I manage this trick because no messages
are actually downloaded until you try to read them.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Third, it lets you pick the email program you want to use to view your
email. Sort of... If your email programs use file associations, things
will work fine. How many times have you downloaded your email just to wish
you'd downloaded <U>this one message</U> with your "other" email program?
Maybe one of your email programs handles attachments or graphics or embedded
items better. I've got things set up so I can view my email with Netscape,
Internet Explorer, Notepad, Outlook Express, and WinZip. Yes, that's "and",
not "or". I can be viewing the same email in all five programs at the same
time.</LI>
</UL>
The program comes complete with source code, sample Windows Scripting code,
and sample DOS batch code. The Windows GUI is kind of sparse because, well,
it's just a convenience feature. Here's some sample screen shots showing
the program running in Windows and DOS modes.&nbsp;</TD>
