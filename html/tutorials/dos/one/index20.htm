<TD>Three files are discussed here. The first, <A HREF="#filecap">FileCap</A>,
is a Windows 95 program for capturing serial data. The second, <A HREF="#prn2pbm">Prn2Pbm</A>,
is another Windows 95 program which converts captured PRN files to the
PBM graphic format. Lastly, <A HREF="#doscap">DosCap</A> is a collection
of DOS programs which perform both the above functions (but only under
DOS 5 and 6).&nbsp;
<BR>Why did I write these programs? Simple. I use several pieces of test
equipment which can do a "Print Screen" out to a serial printer. The problem
is, I wanted to embed pictures of these screens in Word documents and web
pages. To top it off, I don't have a serial printer. So I had to capture
the test equipment output onto my PC, then convert that captured file into
a recognizable graphic. I wrote a separate program for each step. Here's
a sample picture of an <A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/prn2pbm/r2660.gif">R2660 spectrum analyzer</A>,
a <A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/prn2pbm/sunset.gif">SunSet T1 test set</A>, and the <A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/prn2pbm/win95.gif">Windows
95 Printer Test Page</A>.</TD>

<TD><A NAME="filecap"></A>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><IMG SRC="filecap.gif" HEIGHT=251 WIDTH=275 ALIGN=LEFT>FileCap,unlike
most other programs, will reliably capture streaming binary data intact.
Use it to capture serial printer data using a nul modem (For example the
output of an R2660, SunSet T1, or other dedicated test equipment) or use
it to capture EBTS data. You'll need to have previously installed a VB5
program or the <A HREF="http://www.hotfiles.com/?000LU3">VB5 runtime files</A>.
I got tired of install programs failing, so none is included.

<HR WIDTH="100%"><IMG SRC="prn2pbm.gif" HEIGHT=313 WIDTH=263 ALIGN=RIGHT>Provided
you have a captured IBM-Graphics printer file, this program will convert
it to the rare (but easy to program for) PBM file format. You'll need to
have previously installed a VB5 program or the <A HREF="http://www.hotfiles.com/?000LU3">VB5
runtime files</A>. I got tired of install programs failing, so none is
included. You can use <A HREF="http://www.lview.com/">LView</A>,&nbsp;
<A HREF="http://www.jasc.com/">PaintShop</A>, or a similar graphics utility
to convert the PBM files to whatever you want.&nbsp;

<A NAME="doscap"></A>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">DosCap contains DOS versions of a serial capture program
and a PRN2PBM conversion program. Both the executable and the QBasic source
code are included -- which you'll need. The capture program has hard-coded
settings for the serial port, so you're better off running the QBasic code
interpreted and tweaking it as needed to get your serial ports set up.
Frankly, neither of these programs was ever entirely stable, but they both
<B>did</B> work. Both cause spectacular errors if you try to run them under
Windows 95. I have no idea why...</TD>
