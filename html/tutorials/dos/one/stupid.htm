<P>The "Stupid Jerk" virus is a Word macro virus that only affects Win32
platforms. On the 14th day of the last six months in the year, it activates
and pops up a dialog proclaiming "I think &lt;user> is a big stupid jerk!"
(where &lt;user> is replaced by the user's actual name).
<P>In addition to popping the dialog, the virus also disables Word's built-in
macro virus protection warning. This disabling probably won't have an effect
on Word 2000, which has a different Macro Virus warning scheme. However,
Office 2000 is in beta now (12/98), so I can't really be sure. The virus
modifies itself slightly by including the name of the infected person in
the code and by renaming ToolsMacro and AutoOpen subroutines on the fly.
The virus also modifies the system registry, effectively changing the registered
name and organization for Windows 95 and 98 computers (the changes it makes
are ignored by NT). The new registered name is "VicodinES /CB /TNN" and
the new registered organization is "-(Dr. Diet Mountain Dew)-". To see
your computer's registered name and organization, open the Control Panel
(Start / Settings / Control Panel) and double-click the "System" applet
icon.
<P>Assuming you have cleaned yourself of the infection, you'll still need
to undo the changes the virus made. The following batch files will walk
you through the process.
<P>If you are an individual user with Win95 or 98, you can download the
program in either of the following formats:
<BR><A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/virus/stupid.zip"><IMG SRC="zip.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=33 WIDTH=35></A><TT><B><A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/virus/stupid.zip">stupid.zip</A></B>
</TT>-&nbsp;
zip file containing stupid.bat which asks you for information and prompts
you for each change.
<BR><A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/virus/stupid.exe"><IMG SRC="stupid.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=33 WIDTH=35></A><TT><B><A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/virus/stupid.exe">stupid.exe</A></B>
</TT>-&nbsp;
self-extracting and auto-starting version of stupid.bat.
<P>If you are a network administrator in a mixed 95/98/NT environment,
you can download this program:
<BR><A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/virus/jerk.zip"><IMG SRC="zip.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=33 WIDTH=35></A><TT><B><A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/virus/jerk.zip">jerk.zip</A></B>
</TT>-&nbsp;
zip file containing jerk.bat which runs with no user intervention.
