<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#CC33CC"><FONT SIZE=+1>WRITE : </FONT></FONT></B>This
is still the only format other than straight text that you know can be
viewed under 3.1 and 95. What's more, Write makes a passable binary editor.
You can open executables, search for, copy or modify data, and resave the
executable without any unintentional side effects. I love reading the passwords
in old Word files, checking the versions on old DLL files, changing prompts
in programs... Windows 95's new WordPad flat out refuses to open executables
for all this fun.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CC33CC"><FONT SIZE=+1>TERMINAL: </FONT></FONT></B>I
do not want to choose from a cheesy list of icons every time I use the
new "HyperTerminal" program.&nbsp; I just want to start typing. Besides,
Terminal lets me create up to 24 on-screen "hot keys" I can click.&nbsp;
HyperTerminal won't do that. When I need advanced features, I use an advanced
program. When I need simplicity, I use Terminal.&nbsp; HyperTerminal is
neither.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CC33CC"><FONT SIZE=+1>EDIT : </FONT></FONT></B>How
many ways can you garbage a plain text file? Try reading a UNIX (linefeeds,
but no carriage returns) file. Try saving an HTML file whose source you've
hijacked from Netscape. Try reading a text file that has been in a "binary/text"
FTP upload/download fight and lost. You'd be surprised how many text file
problems can be fixed by simply opening the file with EDIT and saving it.
EDIT converts LF to CRLF, and does it without telling you. The "without
telling you" part must've upset some people, because the new '95 DOS 7
EDIT won't do all this. Old DOS 6 EDIT is still handy!

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CC33CC"><FONT SIZE=+1>PAINTBRUSH : </FONT></FONT></B>It
isn't much, but it can at least save files to PCX format. Both PCX and
BMP can be read under the new '95 "Paint", but PCX takes up a lot less
room on a disk due to the RLE file compression. This compression only works
on pictures with blocks of the same color, but "Paint" has no native compressed
format at all!

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CC33CC"><FONT SIZE=+1>RECORDER : </FONT></FONT></B>
Okay, you never used it back when you had Windows 3.1. But you're a power user 
now and you find yourself performing repetive tasks. The same keystrokes and 
mouse movements for updating files or something. Mind numbing. Don't you wish 
you could &quot;script&quot; the whole thing and play it back with a single 
keystroke? Recorder does that. It records what you do, then plays it back. 
Windows 95 has nothing like it and Win98 says you have to be a programmer to 
use it's built-in scripting.
