<P>Please refer to 
<A HREF="batch.html">my main batch page</A> to look for general batch solutions. 
If you find any code that won't run on NT, let me know and I'll post the 
NT or NT/95 compatible code fixes here. Note that I didn't say I'd <i>find</i> the 
fix! I'll just post it after you point it out to me.

<P><B><A HREF="ntinput.bat.txt">Get user input from an NT batch
file</A></B>
<BR>NT doesn't process devices like CON and NUL consistently. Because most
user input schemes rely on CON, we are forced to fall back to QBASIC. Luckily,
QBASIC is standard NT equipment.
<P><B><A HREF="ntdate.bat.txt">Put the date into the environment</A></B>
<BR>NT's different prompts and use of "special characters" spoil the Win95
method. Here is a straightforward NT approach. PC Magazine also published
a <A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/pctech/content/solutions/uu1720a.htm">slightly
more complicated</A> (but more versatile?) way.
<P><B><A HREF="getqbasic.bat.txt">Insure QBASIC exists on a
Win95 user's machine</A></B>
<BR>Not just test for it, but download and install it automatically too!
Just stick this code in front of any batch file that needs QBASIC that
may have to run on a Win95 client. This code assumes an internet connection
is available... Amazingly, QBASIC is standard on DOS5, DOS6, and NT, but
seems to have been skipped on Win95.
<P><B><A HREF="jhayes.txt">Joseph Hayes Tips</A></B>
<BR>Pure laziness on my part. When I get cc'ed on an email where Joseph 
posted an NT tip, I put it here. Let me give you a hint: Learn all you can
about the NT &quot;FOR&quot; command.
