<TD WIDTH="100%">Do you need to automatically shut down, reboot, or log
out of a Windows PC? This may be what you need.&nbsp;
<P>I have Windows 95 PC that runs constantly. Well, it would if the OS
could! I use a scheduling program, so I thought I'd have it reboot my system
every weeknight at 3am. At first I was using the rundll program to activate
the Windows shutdown functions. But I had a dickens of a time using the
32-bit methods or passing arguments. This meant I couldn't "force" the
issue. There is only so much you can do with a command line. One stupid
program with an error message on the screen would hang the entire machine.&nbsp;
<P>So I was forced to write my own program. It has no problem doing exactly
what you want. You can log off, reboot, or fully shut down your PC. And
you can force it. The included "readme" file tells you everything you need.
Heck, there are only four optional command-line arguments, and if you forget
them or lose the readme, you can just check the <A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/exitwindows/exitwindows.gif">file
properties</A> to get a reminder.&nbsp;
<P>To get the program, just click the "Download Now!" at the top of the
screen. Full VB5 source code is included. This program needs the Visual
Basic 5 runtime files which you probably already have. So I didn't include 
them in the download! If you need them, you can get 
from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/MSVBVM50.EXE">Microsoft</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.hotfiles.com/?000LU3">Ziff-Davis</A>.</TD>
