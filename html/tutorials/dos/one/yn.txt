If you find yourself trying to automate 
the deletion of files, the formatting of 
floppies, or do anything else REALLY 
INTERESTING, you're going to hit a spot 
where everything stops and you get asked 
"Are you sure?". Sometimes you can pass a 
"/y" on the command line (like the COPY 
command) to override this, but that's the 
exception. Often, you can simply ECHO the 
key you'll need to press into the command. 
As an example, suppose you want to run CHKDSK 
with the /F option to fix errors. If it 
finds errors, it will ask you to type "y" 
or "n".  You can create a batch file which 
will do this for you: 

------------
ECHO Y|CHKDSK /F 
------------

If all you needed to do was to press "Enter", 
you could do this: 

------------
ECHO.|CHKDSK /F 
------------

If you need to press "y", AND THEN HIT "Enter", 
it gets more complicated. You have to create 
what is generally called a "script" containing 
the exact keystrokes you need to press. You can 
create it  ahead of time, or as needed like this: 

------------
ECHO Y>SCRIPT.TXT 
ECHO.>>SCRIPT.TXT 
TYPE SCRIPT.TXT|CHKDSK /F 
------------

Notice the first line had only one ">", but the 
second line had two ">>". Just one will cause the 
SCRIPT.TXT to be created new (if it already exists, 
it will be erased to start over fresh). The two >> 
will cause things to be appended to the existing 
SCRIPT.TXT
