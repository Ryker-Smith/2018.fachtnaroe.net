<p>Pssst...&nbsp; I found free theme software. Why do you care?
You need theme software if you want to (easily) install any
&quot;Themes&quot; on your PC. What's a Theme? Well, when you set
your Windows colors up, you can select from several &quot;Schemes&quot;.
These schemes are preset combinations of colors. Themes take it a
step further. You get preset colors <b><u>and </u></b>wallpaper,
screensaver, sounds, and cursors. The works! You can even save
your settings and send them to other people. This is just the
thing for corporate computer standards or people who want to show
off their custom wallpaper and system event sounds.</p>

<p>The program is called Kids Plus Underwater Demo. It is (Microsoft
thinks) a demo of the Microsoft Plus! for Kids program. You used
to be able to get it at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/kids">Microsoft's
kids web site</a>, but they pulled it. Bummer. Things change.
Until Microsoft changes things again, you can <a
href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/deskapps/kids/kidplusd.exe">get it
on their FTP site</a>. The place you can <strong>always</strong>
get it is off the old MSN version 2.5 CD you or a friend might
have saved (You just never know when those old CDs may be handy).
On the CD or website you'll get a file called &quot;kidplusd.exe&quot;.
If you do nothing more than run it and let it install the demo,
you'll be okay. But you don't have to be satisfied with the demo.
Microsoft was kind enough to include the full version -- if you
know where to find it! </p>

<p>There are three ways to convert the demo into the real version.
The object is to replace the &quot;themesd.exe&quot; demo file
that will be installed with the correct &quot;themes.exe&quot;
file. <br>
<strong>1) </strong>If you have the latest version of <a
href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a>, you can install the demo,
then use WinZip to open kidplusd.exe. Inside kidplusd.exe you'll
find demothm1.cab. Again, use Winzip to open demothm1.cab. When
you open demothm1.cab, you'll find the themes.exe you want. <br>
<strong>2) </strong>Microsoft had to post a fix to the themes.exe
program. Kewl! The fixed themes.exe program shows up in lots of
places, including <a
href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/themes.exe">Microsoft's
FTP site</a>. Just get it.<br>
<strong>3) </strong>When you run the &quot;kidplusd.exe&quot;
self-extracting file, it creates several files in your temporary
directory. One of these is &quot;Demothm1.cab&quot;. This file
will only exist while the install program is running, so ignore
the first dialog box the installation program gives you and
extract the file &quot;themes.exe&quot; from the cab file while
you can. To extract individual files from a cab file, you can
either run the<b><tt> extract </tt></b>command from a dos window,
use WinZip, or you can install the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wutoys/w95pwrtoysset/default.asp">cabview</a>
powertoy. You can see an example of running the install program
from a CDROM and stealing the resulting themes.exe file <a
href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/plus/plus.gif"><b>here</b></a>.&nbsp; After you get your themes.exe,
you can proceed with the installation. Replace themesd.exe with
themes.exe after the installation finishes.<br>
