You have lots of documents you want printed, but you 
don't want to sit there and do each one separately? 
Maybe you don't even want to open all of them at once? 
Well, most word processing programs will print the file 
passed to them if you use the /p option. If you use START 
with the /w option, only one file will be done at a time. 
If you use START's /m option as well, your word processor 
will stay minimized so you don't have to watch it (much). 
In the example below, I assume you want to print all TXT 
and BAT files in the current directory, and that you'll 
use NOTEPAD to do the printing. NOTEPAD is nice because by
default it prints filenames at the top of each page and 
page numbers at the bottom. 

for %%x in (*.txt *.bat) do start /w /m notepad.exe /p "%%x" 

If you want to change the file name that gets printed, type:
lfnfor off
before you run it and you'll get short file names. Type:
lfnfor on
to get long file names.

If you want to print 10 copies, Make a separate batch file 
to call the first one:
for %%x in (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10) do call printall.bat
