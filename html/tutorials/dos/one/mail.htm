<p>Oops... My email volume has increased so much that it's cutting into
my REAL work. Which I can't have! These web pages went from nothing to
over 100,000 hits a month and the email tracked up with it. So I'm having
to pull my work email address from here. To those
individuals who can find my work address, I still welcome your questions. My work email
is checked daily, and my personal email is checked about once a week. My personal home email address is 
<b><font color="#FF0000">webspace</font></b> at <b><font color="#FF0000">calweb.com</font></b>
. Sorry it isn't a link or a cut'n'paste address, but listing it this way cuts down on robot email collectors. Meanwhile,
read the next two paragraphs.
<p><b><font color="#993366"><font size=+1>Are you using NT?</font></font></b>
<br><b>Everything I do (programs, batch files, and scripts) is created
under Win95.</b> That means it might work under NT. And it might not! If
you have an NT batch question, you might want to send it to Joseph Hayes
(<b><font color="#FF0000">JHayes</font></b> at <b><font color="#FF0000">cbny.com</font></b>).
He's way better at NT than I am. Joseph has very kindly volunteered his
time to help out other NT batch programmers. I, on the other hand, have
an NT server at home that I only use to watch TV on (gasp!) because I got
tired of having to reboot the TV under Win95 every two weeks. So if I'm
pressed to come up with a batch solution that works under Win95 and NT
(like you already have working NT code and you need help translating to
Win9x), I at least have access to both platforms for testing. Other than
that, I'm likely to give you Win95 answers to your NT questions. Kind of
a waste of your time.
<p><b><font color="#993366"><font size=+1>Before you send me mail...</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">If you have a code problem, </font>I ask that
you <a href="~webspace.html">start at my home page</a> and navigate your way down.</b>
I'm hoping a search engine sent you to one of my pages and all you need
is to start from the top to find the page that really holds your answer.
At least try it! Anyway... <b>Send me whatever files you have</b> (whatever
you can) along with a description of what it is you are trying to accomplish.
Try to tell me your overall goal as well as the approach you are trying
to take. If you get error messages, <b>try to include a screen dump</b>.
Lastly, if you copied (you know, copy and paste?) code off one of my web
pages and it doesn't work right, go back and make sure you don't have any
spaces at the ends of your lines. Spaces may be invisible, but they cause
problems!
<p><b><font color="#993366"><font size=+1>My philosophy of giving away
code</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of my code is copyrighted. That
means you can use it anywhere, any time, guilt-free.&nbsp; It also means
you can recompile any of my stuff, take my name off it, sell it, and keep
all the money. I do things this way because people in business have to
be very careful not to use the copyrighted work of others. And I give my
code away (by posting it on the Internet) expecting it to be used.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider my code to be in the same
ballpark as the sample code Microsoft is always giving away. Well, if I'm
in the ballpark, maybe Microsoft is on the pitcher's mound and I'm up in
the cheap seats eating a hot dog. But I'm still in the ballpark. It's just
simple code that anybody could write. It's only real value is that it provides
a good "this works" starting point.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheesh! I've actually seen people copyright
a single line of code! Like from now on, nobody can use the DIR command
in a batch file because some fool put a copyright on it? As if! These kind
of people believe every idea they have is an original concept made of gold.
Seeing these people reminds me not to end up becoming a fat-head like them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, I could copyright my code, then
say it's freely redistributable. Lots of people do. Or I could GPL it all.
But the simple fact is that all of these are (as broad as they are) still
restrictions. And I have no intention of hunting down or prosecuting people
who might violate these simple restrictions. I have better things to do
with my time. People who don't intend to fight shouldn't draw lines in
the sand.
