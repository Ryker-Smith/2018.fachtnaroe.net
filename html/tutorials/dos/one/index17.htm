<TD>This is a VBA module that can be dropped into any Excel97 spreadsheet
to give it single-player Pong-playing capability.&nbsp; This was done just
because it <B>can</B> be done. What other reason is there?&nbsp;

<P>As it is currently written, pressing the "F12" key starts Pong, and
pressing the "Escape" key stops Pong. The right and left arrow keys move
your paddle. If you hit the ball with the side of the paddle, you change
the angle of the resulting bounce. You get a "beep" if you miss the ball.
I usually miss, so I hear lots of beeps. Because I miss so much, I decided
Pong wouldn't keep score. The longest recorded time before becoming bored
with the game is 45 seconds. <B>Pong doesn't affect any data on your spreadsheet.</B>

<P>Here's <A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/pong/pong.gif">how to add the pong module</A> into your spreadsheet.&nbsp;
Here's <A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/pong/pong.txt">the actual pong module</A> you'll need (you might
have to right-click or shift-click it). If you don't want to add Pong to
one of your spreadsheets, here's a blank spreadsheet with <A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/pong/pong.xls">the
pong module already installed</A>. If you click the "Download Now" icon
at the top of the page, you get both the separate module and the installed
spreadsheet together in a zip file.&nbsp;

<P>Although the web isn't the place to try to demo "high-speed" action
games, the animated picture below should give you some small idea of what
the game looks like.&nbsp;</TD>

<BR>This is actually a demo of how to use callbacks from inside VBA. You
aren't actually supposed to be able to do it! VBA doesn't support the "AddressOf"
function, and without it you can't find the address of a function for a
callback. Of course, there is always a low-level undocumented workaround!
Here I use a Windows timer API function and convince it to call back to
one of my routines so I can move the pong ball every few milliseconds.</TD>
