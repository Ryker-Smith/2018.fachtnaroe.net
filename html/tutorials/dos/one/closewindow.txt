FAQ: How do I get my batch file to close it's DOS 
window after it finishes?

Answer: Clear the screen! Just add the following 
two lines to the end of your batch file:
@echo off
cls

It actually makes sense if you think about it. If 
there is something on the screen, DOS will hold 
the window open so you can see the results. But if 
there is NOTHING on the screen, there is no reason 
to keep the window open!
