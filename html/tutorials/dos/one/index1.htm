<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Where to find the missing commands:</FONT></B> If you
have access to your Windows 95 CDROM, you can find almost everything in
the <B><TT>\Other\Oldmsdos </TT></B>directory. If you're like me, you'll
copy every bit of it into your<B><TT> \Windows\Command </TT></B>directory.
If you don't have access to your CDROM, check out Microsoft's web site.

actual files (1.47 megabytes compressed) can be found at:

<BR>Other useful DOS commands are<B> winset.exe </B>and<B> shortcut.exe.
</B>Winset lets you set environment variables globally (they persist once
your batch file ends). Shortcut lets you make and modify shortcuts from
the command line. You'll find both of these together as "envars.exe" on
your CDROM under \Admin\Apptools\Envvars or from Microsoft at:
<BR><A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Products/Windows/Windows95/CDRomExtras/AdministrationTools/ApplicationTools/envars.exe">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Products/Windows/Windows95/CDRomExtras/AdministrationTools/ApplicationTools/envars.exe</A>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Where to get help on DOS commands: </FONT></B>You should
already know about the<B><TT> /? </TT></B>option that every DOS command
responds to. If you have Windows 95 you may wonder why you can't find DOS
command help by using the Help icon on the Start menu. I wonder. But if
you get the missing "OldDos" commands (see the item above), you'll get
the HELP command. Actually, you don't need the HELP.COM file. All it does
is run QBASIC with the undocumented /QHELP option (uppercase) which opens
up the HELP.HLP data file. Yes, you get QBASIC.EXE and HELP.HLP with the
OldDos stuff. You'll also find useful info (even if you thought you knew
it all) by reading the text files in your<B><TT> Windows </TT></B>directory.
If you installed Windows in your C:\Windows directory, I can save you looking 
for some of them by clicking these links (they point to your local drive)

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I write batch programs: </FONT></B>Geez, do
I have to answer this? But people ask... You'd be surprised how many people
are in that narrow transition period of knowing how to type commands, but
not knowing how to put them together in a batch file. Here is the short
version: Get yourself a DOS prompt. Type in the commands you need to do
whatever it is you need to do. If your commands work, open up Notepad and
type those SAME COMMANDS in the SAME ORDER. Don't type what appeared on
the screen, just type what you actually typed in. Save that file with a
bat extension ( For example "test.bat"). Now instead of having to type
the commands, you can just double-click the batch file. Sure, your first
batch file may only have two or three commands, but it counts. It's a batch
program.
