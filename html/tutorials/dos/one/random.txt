This batch file will generate almost random file names. 
To do this, it takes advantage of the fact that "piping" 
needs a guaranteed nonexistent filename in order to store 
the piped data. By piping anything into the DIR command 
(which ignores the piped data), we can actually see the 
filename assigned. We can reuse this filename immediately 
(because the pipe is done with it), or use it or part of 
it as random. The MODE command is misused here in order 
to generate a "line fragment" to turn the single line of 
data we get into a batch file.
------------------
@echo off
::  First generate a line fragment
mode = > #nvalid.bat
::  Get a picture of what's in TEMP now
dir %temp% > dir1.txt
::  Now pipe something and look at TEMP again
echo.|dir %temp% > dir2.txt
::  Compare the two DIRs. The difference is the 
::  almost random name assigned by the pipe. Put
::  the results on the end of the fragment
fc /lb1 dir1.txt dir2.txt | find ":" >> #nvalid.bat
::  Now create an "INVALID.BAT" to do out work
echo set TEMPNAME=%%3> invalid.bat
::  Now we can run our "#invalid.bat" which will
::  in turn run our "invalid.bat"
call #nvalid.bat
echo %TEMPNAME% is the random name
::  Now clean up
set TEMPNAME=
del ?nvalid.bat
del dir?.txt
