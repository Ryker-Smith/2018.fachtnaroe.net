<TD>This is a Word 97 document with embedded macros which allow you to
automatically search through multiple documents in multiple directories,
and replace multiple words. For example, you could replace "Smart SMR of
California" with "Nextel Communications", and simultaneously replace "SMART"
with "Nextel" -- and do it on hundreds of files scattered across your network.&nbsp;

<P>Why did I write it? Because the California Nextel legal entity did go
through a name change! We needed to change thousands of documents and templates.
They were estimating it would take six months to complete. And they were
actually doing it manually. I spent one week writing and testing the program,
then gave it to our property manager who let it loose on the network. After
two hours of watching the screen fly, our office finished the "six month"
job.

<P>You'll have to fill out a list of your file masks and word replacements,
for example:&nbsp;
<BR><B><TT>E:\data\Projects\Leases\*.doc&nbsp;</TT></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B><TT>C:\Documents\*.doc&nbsp;</TT></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B><TT>SMART SMR=NEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS</TT></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B><TT>Smart SMR=Nextel Communications</TT></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B><TT>SMART=NEXTEL</TT></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B><TT>Smart=Nextel</TT></B>&nbsp;

<P>Frankly, there are other programs written that can do this, but I couldn't
get them to work. By using Word 97, I am able to open almost anything.
Obviously, you'll need to have Word configured so it can open and save
whatever it is you'll be modifying.

<P>I've noticed that the "GSR.DOC" file doesn't like to be run from the
network. It throws a path/file access error at startup. So put the darn
thing on your local (C:) drive and run it from there!

<P>If files are read-protected by a password, you'll have to enter the
password when the macro stops and asks you for it. If you hit a file that
is write-protected, The macro will skip it. Any file that the macro cannot
do an open, replace, and save operation on will be logged (And the list
is displayed automatically for you when the macro finishes). Likewise,
a list is generated and displayed showing every change that was made.

<P>Because the file linked in the "Download Now" is the actual Word document,
you may have to right-click to convince your browser to
download (versus display) the file.

<P>A nice fellow asked me about changing text in headers and footers, so 
I added that capability as well <A HREF="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/word/gsr2.doc">here</a>. Unfortunately, 
I haven't tested this modification on hundreds of documents like my original 
version. Let me know if it works for you.
