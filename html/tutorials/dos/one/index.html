to get the "missing" DOS commands. Where to get help on DOS.
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="index2.htm">NT Batch Programming</a></font></b>Not
a tutorial, just a listing of code fixes for NT when the techniques shown
on this page won't work.
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="samples.htm">Sample Batch Files</a></font></b>
Maybe your problem has already been solved.
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="index3.htm">Getting User Input</a></font></b>
Four different methods are discussed. Batch menus, using the CON device
with FC and Ctrl-Z, and using CHOICE to effect invisible password entry.
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="index4.htm">Creating Secondary Batch
Files</a></font></b> How to use a batch file to create another batch file,
debug script, or basic program as it is needed.
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="index5.htm">Processing a Line of Data</a></font></b>
The most widely-implemented method of processing lines involves getting
the name of a batch file on the beginning of a line of data. This allows
the data on the line to be passed as arguments to the batch file.
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="index6.htm">Processing Characters
in a Word</a></font></b> Once you know how to extract and work with the
individual words in a line, you'll find yourself wanting to work with the
individual letters in the words.
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="index7.htm">Processing Lists</a></font></b>
Assuming you know how to process individual lines, you have to find a way
around DOS' annoying program flow. It never returns when you want it to.
Here's how to keep DOS on task and process every line in a file.
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="filelist.htm">Making and Processing
Lists of File Names</a></font></b> Actually just using the DIR command
appropriately, then processing the result with the techniques shown above.
But it is such a common question...
<p><b><font size=+1><a href="index8.htm">Stupid DOS Tricks</a></font></b>
These tricks aren't widely known and are almost never used. Usually because
they never seem to apply to whatever it is you're working on at the moment.
