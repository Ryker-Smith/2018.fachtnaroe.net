<h1><a id="CITXX"></a><b>Course Option 1:</b> Computer Systems &amp; Programming (IT)&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;FETAC/QQI level 5</h1>
<p>This course seeks to provide participants with high levels of competence in the digital world, encouraging creative thought both on paper and online.</p>
<p>While we seek to prepare students for successful progression to 3<sup>rd</sup> level education, this course equally offers skills which no modern Irish worker should be without.</p>

We seek to facilitate the student in achieving a set of software skills in excess of the standard, with a view to self reliance and independence of thought.</p>
<p>While this course is very much geared towards the student who has an interest and fascination with the computer itself, it will also provide the student with the problem-solving skills essential to function effectively in a changing office environment.</p>

<h1>Getting your award</h1>
<ul>
  <li>You need to complete core IT modules.</li>
  <li>You need to complete general modules, such as Work Experience and Communications</li>
  <li>A minimum total of <b>8</b> modules <b>including</b> the mandatory modules.
  <aside>
  The FETAC system is undergoing changes at the moment as part of the move over to a Common National Awards System. The mechanism of calculation for Computing and Information Technology awards is changing from December 2014 onwards. You'll need to check back to keep up-to-date...
  </aside></li>
  <li>You will be expected to attempt and complete in excess of the minimum; this will begin to raise your IT knowledge levels to the standard required of a successful IT professional in the modern workplace.</li>
  </ul>
<h1>Component Certificate</h1>
<p>A Component Certificate (<i>formerly a</i> Record of Achievement) is awarded to a learner who successfully completes one <i>or more</i> modules at any level, but does not have either:</p>
<ul class="ulul">
    <li>sufficient modules (minimum 8) for that level, or</li>
    <li>an apropriate combination of modules for an award,</li>
    <li>and thus does qualify for a full award Certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Component Certificates are awarded for the achievement of individual areas of learning, which can stand alone or build towards the achievement of a full certificate. Components are of interest to employers because they name specific areas which can further inform their choice of candidate.</p>
<p>For further details please consult the publication <a href="http://www.fetac.ie/fetac/awardsinfo/directory/directory.htm">FETAC (NCVA) Awards</a> or visit <a href="http://www.fetac.ie">www.fetac.ie</a>.</p>

<h1>Sharing</h1>
<p>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. <br>-<i>Thomas Jefferson</i> 1813.</p>
