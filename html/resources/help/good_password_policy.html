<h1>Good Password Policy</h1>
<table><tr><td>
This policy applies to every person using computers. (Computers with operating systems not providing password protection are not covered). When connected to networks, means of protecting data are required. Passwords are the most common means.
<br /><br />
Passwords <B>must</B> not be shared. It is against school policy; sometimes it's even illegal to use another's account or files. Failure to conform to these restrictions may lead to suspension of the user or other action as provided by the Schools <a href="00-AUP-PLC-20060907.pdf">Acceptable Usage Policy</a> or <a href="00-AUP-PLC-20060907.pdf">AUP</a>.
<h2>Password Guidelines:</h2>

The following guidelines are based upon experience and common sense:
<ol>
   <li>It must be at least six characters in length. (Longer is generally better).</li>
   <li>Ideally it would contain a mix of alphabetic and numeric characters.</li>
   <li>It must be significantly different from previous passwords.</li>
   <li>It cannot be the same as the userid.</li>
   <li>It cannot start or end with the initials of the person issued the userid.</li>
   <li>It cannot include the first, middle, or last name of the person issued the userid.</li>
   <li>It should not be information easily obtainable about you. This includes:
		<ul>
			<li>License plate.</li>
			<li>PPS number.</li>
			<li>Telephone numbers.</li>
			<li>Street address.</li>
			<li>Dates of birth.</li>
			<li>Spouse or family members name.</li>
	 	</ul>
</ol>   
Sometimes the easiest way to make up a new password is to think of two words and put them together - without a space between them.
<p>If you forget your password and can't log on you'll have to talk to the network administrator or your PLC tutor.
