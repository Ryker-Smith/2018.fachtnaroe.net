<h1>First Chair</h1>
<p>The First Chair of Programming is allocated to the learner who has the best combination of prior programming knowledge upon enrolment, and has other soft skills that make them suitable for the role. The First Chair is not allocated every year.</p>
<p>As First Chair, you'll be given root access to the student server, via the sudo command.</p>
<p>When you type a maintenance command and get an error saying that:<br><pre>You need to be root to perform this command.</pre>... you can prefix that command  with the word <b>sudo</b> and continue.</p>
<p>You'll have to give your password to prove you are who you say you are. There is also a warning which you <b>must</b> read.</p>
<pre>We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility
